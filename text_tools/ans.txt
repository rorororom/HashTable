never

with
strangers
at
the
hour
of
the
hot
spring
sunset
two
citizens
appeared
at
the
patriarch
s
ponds
one
of
them
approximately
forty
years
old
dressed
in
a
grey
summer
suit
was
short
darkhaired
plump
bald
and
carried
his
respectable
fedora
hat
in
his
hand
his
neatly
shaven
face
was
adorned
with
black
hornrimmed
glasses
of
a
supernatural
size
the
other
a
broadshouldered
young
man
with
tousled
reddish
hair
his
checkered
cap
cocked
back
on
his
head
was
wearing
a
cowboy
shirt
wrinkled
white
trousers
and
black
sneakers
the
first
was
none
other
than
mikhail
alexandrovich
berlioz
editor
of
a
fat
literary
journal
and
chairman
of
the
board
of
one
of
the
major
moscow
literary
associations
called
massolit
for
short
and
his
young
companion
was
the
poet
ivan
nikolaevich
ponyrev
who
wrote
under
the
pseudonym
of
homeless
once
in
the
shade
of
the
barely
greening
lindens
the
writers
dashed
first
thing
to
a
brightly
painted
stand
with
the
sign
beer
and
soft
drinks
ah
yes
note
must
be
made
of
the
first
oddity
of
this
dreadful
may
evening
there
was
not
a
single
person
to
be
seen
not
only
by
the
stand
but
also
along
the
whole
walk
parallel
to
malaya
bronnaya
street
at
that
hour
when
it
seemed
no
longer
possible
to
breathe
when
the
sun
having
scorched
moscow
was
collapsing
in
a
dry
haze
somewhere
beyond
sadovoye
ring
no
one
came
under
the
lindens
no
one
sat
on
a
bench
the
walk
was
empty
give
us
seltzer
berlioz
asked
there
is
no
seltzer
the
woman
in
the
stand
said
and
for
some
reason
became
offended
is
there
beer
homeless
inquired
in
a
rasping
voice
beer
ll
be
delivered
towards
evening
the
woman
replied
then
what
is
there
asked
berlioz
apricot
soda
only
warm
said
the
woman
well
let
s
have
it
let
s
have
it
the
soda
produced
an
abundance
of
yellow
foam
and
the
air
began
to
smell
of
a
barbershop
having
finished
drinking
the
writers
immediately
started
to
hiccup
paid
and
sat
down
on
a
bench
face
to
the
pond
and
back
to
bronnaya
here
the
second
oddity
occurred
touching
berlioz
alone
he
suddenly
stopped
hiccuping
his
heart
gave
a
thump
and
dropped
away
somewhere
for
an
instant
then
came
back
but
with
a
blunt
needle
lodged
in
it
besides
that
berlioz
was
gripped
by
fear
groundless
yet
so
strong
that
he
wanted
to
flee
the
ponds
at
once
without
looking
back
berlioz
looked
around
in
anguish
not
understanding
what
had
frightened
him
he
paled
wiped
his
forehead
with
a
handkerchief
thought
what
s
the
matter
with
me
this
has
never
happened
before
my
heart
s
acting
up
i
m
overworked
maybe
it
s
time
to
send
it
all
to
the
devil
and
go
to
kislovodsk
and
here
the
sweltering
air
thickened
before
him
and
a
transparent
citizen
of
the
strangest
appearance
wove
himself
out
of
it
a
peaked
jockey
s
cap
on
his
little
head
a
short
checkered
jacket
also
made
of
air
a
citizen
seven
feet
tall
but
narrow
in
the
shoulders
unbelievably
thin
and
kindly
note
with
a
jeering
physiognomy
the
life
of
berlioz
had
taken
such
a
course
that
he
was
unaccustomed
to
extraordinary
phenomena
turning
paler
still
he
goggled
his
eyes
and
thought
in
consternation
this
can
t
be
but
alas
it
was
and
the
long
seethrough
citizen
was
swaying
before
him
to
the
left
and
to
the
right
without
touching
the
ground
here
terror
took
such
possession
of
berlioz
that
he
shut
his
eyes
when
he
opened
them
again
he
saw
that
it
was
all
over
the
phantasm
had
dissolved
the
checkered
one
had
vanished
and
with
that
the
blunt
needle
had
popped
out
of
his
heart
pah
the
devil
exclaimed
the
editor
you
know
ivan
i
nearly
had
heatstroke
just
now
there
was
even
something
like
a
hallucination
he
attempted
to
smile
but
alarm
still
jumped
in
his
eyes
and
his
hands
trembled
however
he
gradually
calmed
down
fanned
himself
with
his
handkerchief
and
having
said
rather
cheerfully
well
and
so
went
on
with
the
conversation
interrupted
by
their
sodadrinking
this
conversation
as
was
learned
afterwards
was
about
jesus
christ
the
thing
was
that
the
editor
had
commissioned
from
the
poet
a
long
antireligious
poem
for
the
next
issue
of
his
journal
ivan
nikolaevich
had
written
this
poem
and
in
a
very
short
time
but
unfortunately
the
editor
was
not
at
all
satisfied
with
it
homeless
had
portrayed
the
main
character
of
his
poem
that
is
jesus
in
very
dark
colours
but
nevertheless
the
whole
poem
in
the
editor
s
opinion
had
to
be
written
over
again
and
so
the
editor
was
now
giving
the
poet
something
of
a
lecture
on
jesus
with
the
aim
of
underscoring
the
poet
s
essential
error
it
is
hard
to
say
what
precisely
had
let
ivan
nikolaevich
down
the
descriptive
powers
of
his
talent
or
a
total
unfamiliarity
with
the
question
he
was
writing
about
but
his
jesus
came
out
well
completely
alive
the
onceexisting
jesus
though
true
a
jesus
furnished
with
all
negative
features
now
berlioz
wanted
to
prove
to
the
poet
that
the
main
thing
was
not
how
jesus
was
good
or
bad
but
that
this
same
jesus
as
a
person
simply
never
existed
in
the
world
and
all
the
stories
about
him
were
mere
fiction
the
most
ordinary
mythology
it
must
be
noted
that
the
editor
was
a
wellread
man
and
in
his
conversation
very
skilfully
pointed
to
ancient
historians
for
instance
the
famous
philo
of
alexandria
and
the
brilliantly
educated
flavius
josephus
who
never
said
a
word
about
the
existence
of
jesus
displaying
a
solid
erudition
mikhail
alexandrovich
also
informed
the
poet
among
other
things
that
the
passage
in
the
fifteenth
book
of
tacitus
s
famousannals
the
fortyfourth
chapter
where
mention
is
made
of
the
execution
of
jesus
was
nothing
but
a
later
spurious
interpolation
the
poet
for
whom
everything
the
editor
was
telling
him
was
new
listened
attentively
to
mikhail
alexandrovich
fixing
his
pert
green
eyes
on
him
and
merely
hiccuped
from
time
to
time
cursing
the
apricot
soda
under
his
breath
there
s
not
a
single
eastern
religion
berlioz
was
saying
in
which
as
a
rule
an
immaculate
virgin
did
not
give
birth
to
a
god
and
in
just
the
same
way
without
inventing
anything
new
the
christians
created
their
jesus
who
in
fact
never
lived
it
s
on
this
that
the
main
emphasis
should
be
placed
berlioz
s
high
tenor
rang
out
in
the
deserted
walk
and
as
mikhail
alexandrovich
went
deeper
into
the
maze
which
only
a
highly
educated
man
can
go
into
without
risking
a
broken
neck
the
poet
learned
more
and
more
interesting
and
useful
things
about
the
egyptian
osiris
a
benevolent
god
and
the
son
of
heaven
and
earth
and
about
the
phoenician
god
tammuz
and
about
marduk
and
even
about
a
lesser
known
terrible
god
vitzliputzli
once
greatly
venerated
by
the
aztecs
in
mexico
and
just
at
the
moment
when
mikhail
alexandrovich
was
telling
the
poet
how
the
aztecs
used
to
fashion
figurines
of
vitzliputzli
out
of
dough
the
first
man
appeared
in
the
walk
afterwards
when
frankly
speaking
it
was
already
too
late
various
institutions
presented
reports
describing
this
man
a
comparison
of
them
cannot
but
cause
amazement
thus
the
first
of
them
said
that
the
man
was
short
had
gold
teeth
and
limped
on
his
right
leg
the
second
that
the
man
was
enormously
tall
had
platinum
crowns
and
limped
on
his
left
leg
the
third
laconically
averred
that
the
man
had
no
distinguishing
marks
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
none
of
these
reports
is
of
any
value
first
of
all
the
man
described
did
not
limp
on
any
leg
and
was
neither
short
nor
enormous
but
simply
tall
as
for
his
teeth
he
had
platinum
crowns
on
the
left
side
and
gold
on
the
right
he
was
wearing
an
expensive
grey
suit
and
imported
shoes
of
a
matching
colour
his
grey
beret
was
cocked
rakishly
over
one
ear
under
his
arm
he
carried
a
stick
with
a
black
knob
shaped
like
a
poodle
s
head
he
looked
to
be
a
little
over
forty
mouth
somehow
twisted
cleanshaven
darkhaired
right
eye
black
left
for
some
reason
green
dark
eyebrows
but
one
higher
than
the
other
in
short
a
foreigner
having
passed
by
the
bench
on
which
the
editor
and
the
poet
were
placed
the
foreigner
gave
them
a
sidelong
look
stopped
and
suddenly
sat
down
on
the
next
bench
two
steps
away
from
the
friends
a
german
thought
berlioz
an
englishman
thought
homeless
my
he
must
be
hot
in
those
gloves
and
the
foreigner
gazed
around
at
the
tall
buildings
that
rectangularly
framed
the
pond
making
it
obvious
that
he
was
seeing
the
place
for
the
first
time
and
that
it
interested
him
he
rested
his
glance
on
the
upper
floors
where
the
glass
dazzlingly
reflected
the
brokenup
sun
which
was
for
ever
departing
from
mikhail
alexandrovich
then
shifted
it
lower
down
to
where
the
windows
were
beginning
to
darken
before
evening
smiled
condescendingly
at
something
narrowed
his
eyes
put
his
hands
on
the
knob
and
his
chin
on
his
hands
for
instance
ivan
berlioz
was
saying
you
portrayed
the
birth
of
jesus
the
son
of
god
very
well
and
satirically
but
the
gist
of
it
is
that
a
whole
series
of
sons
of
god
were
born
before
jesus
like
say
the
phoenician
adonis
the
phrygian
attis
the
persian
mithras
and
to
put
it
briefly
not
one
of
them
was
born
or
ever
existed
jesus
included
and
what
s
necessary
is
that
instead
of
portraying
his
birth
or
suppose
the
coming
of
the
magi
you
portray
the
absurd
rumours
of
their
coming
otherwise
it
follows
from
your
story
that
he
really
was
born
here
homeless
made
an
attempt
to
stop
his
painful
hiccuping
by
holding
his
breath
which
caused
him
to
hiccup
more
painfully
and
loudly
and
at
that
same
moment
berlioz
interrupted
his
speech
because
the
foreigner
suddenly
got
up
and
walked
towards
the
writers
they
looked
at
him
in
surprise
excuse
me
please
the
approaching
man
began
speaking
with
a
foreign
accent
but
without
distorting
the
words
if
not
being
your
acquaintance
i
allow
myself
but
the
subject
of
your
learned
conversation
is
so
interesting
that
here
he
politely
took
off
his
beret
and
the
friends
had
nothing
left
but
to
stand
up
and
make
their
bows
no
rather
a
frenchman
thought
berlioz
a
pole
thought
homeless
it
must
be
added
that
from
his
first
words
the
foreigner
made
a
repellent
impression
on
the
poet
but
berlioz
rather
liked
him
that
is
not
liked
but
how
to
put
it
was
interested
or
whatever
may
i
sit
down
the
foreigner
asked
politely
and
the
friends
somehow
involuntarily
moved
apart
the
foreigner
adroitly
sat
down
between
them
and
at
once
entered
into
the
conversation
unless
i
heard
wrong
you
were
pleased
to
say
that
jesus
never
existed
the
foreigner
asked
turning
his
green
left
eye
to
berlioz
no
you
did
not
hear
wrong
berlioz
replied
courteously
that
is
precisely
what
i
was
saying
ah
how
interesting
exclaimed
the
foreigner
what
the
devil
does
he
want
thought
homeless
frowning
and
you
were
agreeing
with
your
interlocutor
inquired
the
stranger
turning
to
homeless
on
his
right
a
hundred
per
cent
confirmed
the
man
who
was
fond
of
whimsical
and
figurative
expressions
amazing
exclaimed
the
uninvited
interlocutor
and
casting
a
thievish
glance
around
and
muffling
his
low
voice
for
some
reason
he
said
forgive
my
importunity
but
as
i
understand
along
with
everything
else
you
also
do
not
believe
in
god
he
made
frightened
eyes
and
added
i
swear
i
won
t
tell
anyone
no
we
don
t
believe
in
god
berlioz
replied
smiling
slightly
at
the
foreign
tourist
s
fright
but
we
can
speak
of
it
quite
freely
the
foreigner
sat
back
on
the
bench
and
asked
even
with
a
slight
shriek
of
curiosity
you
are
atheists
yes
we
re
atheists
berlioz
smilingly
replied
and
homeless
thought
getting
angry
latched
on
to
us
the
foreign
goose
oh
how
lovely
the
astonishing
foreigner
cried
out
and
began
swivelling
his
head
looking
from
one
writer
to
the
other
in
our
country
atheism
does
not
surprise
anyone
berlioz
said
with
diplomatic
politeness
the
majority
of
our
population
consciously
and
long
ago
ceased
believing
in
the
fairy
tales
about
god
here
the
foreigner
pulled
the
following
stunt
he
got
up
and
shook
the
amazed
editor
s
hand
accompanying
it
with
these
words
allow
me
to
thank
you
with
all
my
heart
what
are
you
thanking
him
for
homeless
inquired
blinking
for
some
very
important
information
which
is
of
great
interest
to
me
as
a
traveller
the
outlandish
fellow
explained
raising
his
finger
significantly
the
important
information
apparently
had
indeed
produced
a
strong
impression
on
the
traveller
because
he
passed
his
frightened
glance
over
the
buildings
as
if
afraid
of
seeing
an
atheist
in
every
window
no
he
s
not
an
englishman
thought
berlioz
and
homeless
thought
where
d
he
pick
up
his
russian
that
s
the
interesting
thing
and
frowned
again
but
allow
me
to
ask
you
the
foreign
visitor
spoke
after
some
anxious
reflection
what
then
about
the
proofs
of
god
s
existence
of
which
as
is
known
there
are
exactly
five
alas
berlioz
said
with
regret
not
one
of
these
proofs
is
worth
anything
and
mankind
shelved
them
long
ago
you
must
agree
that
in
the
realm
of
reason
there
can
be
no
proof
of
god
s
existence
bravo
cried
the
foreigner
bravo
you
have
perfectly
repeated
restless
old
immanuel
s
thought
in
this
regard
but
here
s
the
hitch
he
roundly
demolished
all
five
proofs
and
then
as
if
mocking
himself
constructed
a
sixth
of
his
own
kant
s
proof
the
learned
editor
objected
with
a
subtle
smile
is
equally
unconvincing
not
for
nothing
did
schiller
say
that
the
kantian
reasoning
on
this
question
can
satisfy
only
slaves
and
strauss
simply
laughed
at
this
proof
berlioz
spoke
thinking
all
the
while
but
anyhow
who
is
he
and
why
does
he
speak
russian
so
well
they
ought
to
take
this
kant
and
give
him
a
threeyear
stretch
in
solovki
for
such
proofs
ivan
nikolaevich
plumped
quite
unexpectedly
ivan
berlioz
whispered
embarrassed
but
the
suggestion
of
sending
kant
to
solovki
not
only
did
not
shock
the
foreigner
but
even
sent
him
into
raptures
precisely
precisely
he
cried
and
his
green
left
eye
turned
to
berlioz
flashed
just
the
place
for
him
didn
t
i
tell
him
that
time
at
breakfast
as
you
will
professor
but
what
you
ve
thought
up
doesn
t
hang
together
it
s
clever
maybe
but
mighty
unclear
you
ll
be
laughed
at
berlioz
goggled
his
eyes
at
breakfast
to
kant
what
is
this
drivel
he
thought
but
the
outlander
went
on
unembarrassed
by
berlioz
s
amazement
and
addressing
the
poet
sending
him
to
solovki
is
unfeasible
for
the
simple
reason
that
he
has
been
abiding
for
over
a
hundred
years
now
in
places
considerably
more
remote
than
solovki
and
to
extract
him
from
there
is
inno
way
possible
i
assure
you
too
bad
the
feisty
poet
responded
yes
too
bad
the
stranger
agreed
his
eye
flashing
and
went
on
but
here
is
a
question
that
is
troubling
me
if
there
is
no
god
then
one
may
ask
who
governs
human
life
and
in
general
the
whole
order
of
things
on
earth
man
governs
it
himself
homeless
angrily
hastened
to
reply
to
this
admittedly
nonetooclear
question
pardon
me
the
stranger
responded
gently
but
in
order
to
govern
one
needs
after
all
to
have
a
precise
plan
for
a
certain
at
least
somewhat
decent
length
of
time
allow
me
to
ask
you
then
how
can
man
govern
if
he
is
not
only
deprived
of
the
opportunity
of
making
a
plan
for
at
leastsome
ridiculously
short
period
well
say
a
thousand
years
but
cannot
even
vouch
for
his
own
tomorrow
and
in
fact
here
the
stranger
turned
to
berlioz
imagine
that
you
for
instance
start
governing
giving
orders
to
others
and
yourself
generally
so
to
speak
acquire
a
taste
for
it
and
suddenly
you
get
hem
hem
lung
cancer
here
the
foreigner
smiled
sweetly
as
if
the
thought
of
lung
cancer
gave
him
pleasure
yes
cancer
narrowing
his
eyes
like
a
cat
he
repeated
the
sonorous
word
and
so
your
governing
is
over
you
are
no
longer
interested
in
anyone
s
fate
but
your
own
your
family
starts
lying
to
you
feeling
that
something
is
wrong
you
rush
to
learned
doctors
then
to
quacks
and
sometimes
to
fortunetellers
as
well
like
the
first
so
the
second
and
third
are
completely
senseless
as
you
understand
and
it
all
ends
tragically
a
man
who
still
recently
thought
he
was
governing
something
suddenly
winds
up
lying
motionless
in
a
wooden
box
and
the
people
around
him
seeing
that
the
man
lying
there
is
no
longer
good
for
anything
burn
him
in
an
oven
and
sometimes
it
s
worse
still
the
man
has
just
decided
to
go
to
kislovodsk
here
the
foreigner
squinted
at
berlioz
a
trifling
matter
it
seems
but
even
this
he
cannot
accomplish
because
suddenly
no
one
knows
why
he
slips
and
falls
under
a
tramcar
are
you
going
to
say
it
was
he
who
governed
himself
that
way
would
it
not
be
more
correct
to
think
that
he
was
governed
by
someone
else
entirely
and
here
the
unknown
man
burst
into
a
strange
little
laugh
berlioz
listened
with
great
attention
to
the
unpleasant
story
about
the
cancer
and
the
tramcar
and
certain
alarming
thoughts
began
to
torment
him
he
s
not
a
foreigner
he
s
not
a
foreigner
he
thought
he
s
a
most
peculiar
specimen
but
excuse
me
who
is
he
then
you
d
like
to
smoke
i
see
the
stranger
addressed
homeless
unexpectedly
which
kind
do
you
prefer
what
have
you
got
several
the
poet
who
had
run
out
of
cigarettes
asked
glumly
which
do
you
prefer
the
stranger
repeated
okay
our
brand
homeless
replied
spitefully
the
unknown
man
immediately
took
a
cigarette
case
from
his
pocket
and
offered
it
to
homeless
our
brand
editor
and
poet
were
both
struck
not
so
much
by
our
brand
precisely
turning
up
in
the
cigarette
case
as
by
the
cigarette
case
itself
it
was
of
huge
size
made
of
pure
gold
and
as
it
was
opened
a
diamond
triangle
flashed
white
and
blue
fire
on
its
lid
here
the
writers
thought
differently
berlioz
no
a
foreigner
and
homeless
well
devil
take
him
eh
the
poet
and
the
owner
of
the
cigarette
case
lit
up
but
the
nonsmoker
berlioz
declined
i
must
counter
him
like
this
berlioz
decided
yes
man
is
mortal
no
one
disputes
that
but
the
thing
is
however
before
he
managed
to
utter
these
words
the
foreigner
spoke
yes
man
is
mortal
but
that
would
be
only
half
the
trouble
the
worst
of
it
is
that
he
s
sometimes
unexpectedly
mortal
there
s
the
trick
and
generally
he
s
unable
to
say
what
he
s
going
to
do
this
same
evening
what
an
absurd
way
of
putting
the
question
berlioz
thought
and
objected
well
there
s
some
exaggeration
here
about
this
same
evening
i
do
know
more
or
less
certainly
it
goes
without
saying
if
a
brick
should
fall
on
my
head
on
bronnaya
no
brick
the
stranger
interrupted
imposingly
will
ever
fall
on
anyone
s
head
just
out
of
the
blue
in
this
particular
case
i
assure
you
you
are
not
in
danger
of
that
at
all
you
will
die
a
different
death
maybe
you
know
what
kind
precisely
berlioz
inquired
with
perfectly
natural
irony
getting
drawn
into
an
utterly
absurd
conversation
and
will
tell
me
willingly
the
unknown
man
responded
he
looked
berlioz
up
and
down
as
if
he
were
going
to
make
him
a
suit
muttered
through
his
teeth
something
like
one
two
mercury
in
the
second
house
moon
gone
six
disaster
evening
seven
then
announced
loudly
and
joyfully
your
head
will
be
cut
off
homeless
goggled
his
eyes
wildly
and
spitefully
at
the
insouciant
stranger
and
berlioz
asked
grinning
crookedly
by
whom
precisely
enemies
interventionists
no
replied
his
interlocutor
by
a
russian
woman
a
komsomol
girl
hm
berlioz
mumbled
vexed
at
the
stranger
s
little
joke
well
excuse
me
but
that
s
not
very
likely
and
i
beg
you
to
excuse
me
the
foreigner
replied
but
it
s
so
ah
yes
i
wanted
to
ask
you
what
are
you
going
to
do
tonight
if
it
s
not
a
secret
it
s
not
a
secret
right
now
i
ll
stop
by
my
place
on
sadovaya
and
then
at
ten
this
evening
there
will
be
a
meeting
at
massolit
and
i
will
chair
it
no
that
simply
cannot
be
the
foreigner
objected
firmly
why
not
because
the
foreigner
replied
and
narrowing
his
eyes
looked
into
the
sky
where
anticipating
the
cool
of
the
evening
black
birds
were
tracing
noiselessly
annushka
has
already
bought
the
sunflower
oil
and
has
not
only
bought
it
but
has
already
spilled
it
so
the
meeting
will
not
take
place
here
quite
understandably
silence
fell
under
the
lindens
forgive
me
berlioz
spoke
after
a
pause
glancing
at
the
drivelspouting
foreigner
but
what
has
sunflower
oil
got
to
do
with
it
and
which
annushka
sunflower
oil
has
got
this
to
do
with
it
homeless
suddenly
spoke
obviously
deciding
to
declare
war
on
the
uninvited
interlocutor
have
you
ever
happened
citizen
to
be
in
a
hospital
for
the
mentally
ill
ivan
mikhail
alexandrovich
exclaimed
quietly
but
the
foreigner
was
not
a
bit
offended
and
burst
into
the
merriest
laughter
i
have
i
have
and
more
than
once
he
cried
out
laughing
but
without
taking
his
unlaughing
eye
off
the
poet
where
haven
t
i
been
only
it
s
too
bad
i
didn
t
get
around
to
asking
the
professor
what
schizophrenia
is
so
you
will
have
to
find
that
out
from
him
yourself
ivan
nikolaevich
how
do
you
know
my
name
gracious
ivan
nikolaevich
who
doesn
t
know
you
here
the
foreigner
took
out
of
his
pocket
the
previous
day
s
issue
of
the
literarygazette
and
ivan
nikolaevich
saw
his
own
picture
on
the
very
first
page
and
under
it
his
very
own
verses
but
the
proof
of
fame
and
popularity
which
yesterday
had
delighted
the
poet
this
time
did
not
delight
him
a
bit
excuse
me
he
said
and
his
face
darkened
could
you
wait
one
little
moment
i
want
to
say
a
couple
of
words
to
my
friend
oh
with
pleasure
exclaimed
the
stranger
it
s
so
nice
here
under
the
lindens
and
by
the
way
i
m
not
in
any
hurry
listen
here
misha
the
poet
whispered
drawing
berlioz
aside
he
s
no
foreign
tourist
he
s
a
spy
a
russian
émigré
who
has
crossed
back
over
ask
for
his
papers
before
he
gets
away
you
think
so
berlioz
whispered
worriedly
and
thought
why
he
s
right
believe
me
the
poet
rasped
into
his
ear
he
s
pretending
to
be
a
fool
in
order
to
find
out
something
or
other
just
hear
how
he
speaks
russian
as
he
spoke
the
poet
kept
glancing
sideways
to
make
sure
the
stranger
did
not
escape
let
s
go
and
detain
him
or
he
ll
get
away
and
the
poet
pulled
berlioz
back
to
the
bench
by
the
arm
the
unknown
man
was
not
sitting
but
was
standing
near
it
holding
in
his
hands
some
booklet
in
a
darkgrey
binding
a
sturdy
envelope
made
of
good
paper
and
a
visiting
card
excuse
me
for
having
forgotten
in
the
heat
of
our
dispute
to
introduce
myself
here
is
my
card
my
passport
and
an
invitation
to
come
to
moscow
for
a
consultation
the
stranger
said
weightily
giving
both
writers
a
penetrating
glance
they
were
embarrassed
the
devil
he
heard
everything
berlioz
thought
and
with
a
polite
gesture
indicated
that
there
was
no
need
to
show
papers
while
the
foreigner
was
pushing
them
at
the
editor
the
poet
managed
to
make
out
the
word
professor
printed
in
foreign
type
on
the
card
and
the
initial
letter
of
the
last
name
a
double
v
w
my
pleasure
the
editor
meanwhile
muttered
in
embarrassment
and
the
foreigner
put
the
papers
back
in
his
pocket
relations
were
thus
restored
and
all
three
sat
down
on
the
bench
again
you
ve
been
invited
here
as
a
consultant
professor
asked
berlioz
yes
as
a
consultant
you
re
german
homeless
inquired
i
the
professor
repeated
and
suddenly
fell
to
thinking
yes
perhaps
i
am
german
he
said
you
speak
real
good
russian
homeless
observed
oh
i
m
generally
a
polyglot
and
know
a
great
number
of
languages
the
professor
replied
and
what
is
your
field
berlioz
inquired
i
am
a
specialist
in
black
magic
there
he
goes
struck
in
mikhail
alexandrovich
s
head
and
and
you
ve
been
invited
here
in
that
capacity
he
asked
stammering
yes
in
that
capacity
the
professor
confirmed
and
explained
in
a
state
library
here
some
original
manuscripts
of
the
tenthcentury
necromancer
gerbert
of
aurillac
have
been
found
so
it
is
necessary
for
me
to
sort
them
out
i
am
the
only
specialist
in
the
world
aha
you
re
a
historian
berlioz
asked
with
great
relief
and
respect
i
am
a
historian
the
scholar
confirmed
and
added
with
no
rhyme
or
reason
this
evening
there
will
be
an
interesting
story
at
the
ponds
once
again
editor
and
poet
were
extremely
surprised
but
the
professor
beckoned
them
both
to
him
and
when
they
leaned
towards
him
whispered
bear
in
mind
that
jesus
did
exist
you
see
professor
berlioz
responded
with
a
forced
smile
we
respect
your
great
learning
but
on
this
question
we
hold
to
a
different
point
of
view
there
s
no
need
for
any
points
of
view
the
strange
professor
replied
he
simply
existed
that
s
all
but
there
s
need
for
some
proof
berlioz
began
there
s
no
need
for
any
proofs
replied
the
professor
and
he
began
to
speak
softly
while
his
accent
for
some
reason
disappeared
it
s
all
very
simple
in
a
white
cloak
with
bloodred
lining
with
the
shuffling
gait
of
a
cavalryman
early
in
the
morning
of
the
fourteenth
day
of
the
spring
month
of
nisan
chapter
pontius
pilate
in
a
white
cloak
with
bloodred
lining
with
the
shuffling
gait
of
a
cavalryman
early
in
the
morning
of
the
fourteenth
day
of
the
spring
month
of
nisan
there
came
out
to
the
covered
colonnade
between
the
two
wings
of
the
palace
of
herod
the
great
the
procurator
of
judea
pontius
pilate
more
than
anything
in
the
world
the
procurator
hated
the
smell
of
rose
oil
and
now
everything
foreboded
a
bad
day
because
this
smell
had
been
pursuing
the
procurator
since
dawn
it
seemed
to
the
procurator
that
a
rosy
smell
exuded
from
the
cypresses
and
palms
in
the
garden
that
the
smell
of
leather
trappings
and
sweat
from
the
convoy
was
mingled
with
the
cursed
rosy
flux
from
the
outbuildings
at
the
back
of
the
palace
where
the
first
cohort
of
the
twelfth
lightning
legion
which
had
come
to
yershalaim
with
the
procurator
was
quartered
a
whiff
of
smoke
reached
the
colonnade
across
the
upper
terrace
of
the
palace
and
this
slightly
acrid
smoke
which
testified
that
the
centuries
mess
cooks
had
begun
to
prepare
dinner
was
mingled
with
the
same
thick
rosy
scent
oh
gods
gods
why
do
you
punish
me
yes
no
doubt
this
is
it
this
is
it
again
the
invincible
terrible
illness
hemicrania
when
half
of
the
head
aches
there
s
no
remedy
for
it
no
escape
i
ll
try
not
to
move
my
head
on
the
mosaic
floor
by
the
fountain
a
chair
was
already
prepared
and
the
procurator
without
looking
at
anyone
sat
in
it
and
reached
his
hand
out
to
one
side
his
secretary
deferentially
placed
a
sheet
of
parchment
in
this
hand
unable
to
suppress
a
painful
grimace
the
procurator
ran
a
cursory
sidelong
glance
over
the
writing
returned
the
parchment
to
the
secretary
and
said
with
difficulty
the
accused
is
from
galilee
was
the
case
sent
to
the
tetrarch
yes
procurator
replied
the
secretary
and
what
then
he
refused
to
make
a
decision
on
the
case
and
sent
the
sanhedrin
s
death
sentence
to
you
for
confirmation
the
secretary
explained
the
procurator
twitched
his
cheek
and
said
quietly
bring
in
the
accused
and
at
once
two
legionaries
brought
a
man
of
about
twentyseven
from
the
garden
terrace
to
the
balcony
under
the
columns
and
stood
him
before
the
procurator
s
chair
the
man
was
dressed
in
an
old
and
torn
lightblue
chiton
his
head
was
covered
by
a
white
cloth
with
a
leather
band
around
the
forehead
and
his
hands
were
bound
behind
his
back
under
the
man
s
left
eye
there
was
a
large
bruise
in
the
comer
of
his
mouth
a
cut
caked
with
blood
the
man
gazed
at
the
procurator
with
anxious
curiosity
the
latter
paused
then
asked
quietly
in
aramaic
so
it
was
you
who
incited
the
people
to
destroy
the
temple
of
yershalaim
the
procurator
sat
as
if
made
of
stone
while
he
spoke
and
only
his
lips
moved
slightly
as
he
pronounced
the
words
the
procurator
was
as
if
made
of
stone
because
he
was
afraid
to
move
his
head
aflame
with
infernal
pain
the
man
with
bound
hands
leaned
forward
somewhat
and
began
to
speak
good
man
believe
me
but
the
procurator
motionless
as
before
and
not
raising
his
voice
in
the
least
straight
away
interrupted
him
is
it
me
that
you
are
calling
a
good
man
you
are
mistaken
it
is
whispered
about
me
in
yershalaim
that
i
am
a
fierce
monster
and
that
is
perfectly
correct
and
he
added
in
the
same
monotone
bring
the
centurion
ratslayer
it
seemed
to
everyone
that
it
became
darker
on
the
balcony
when
the
centurion
of
the
first
century
mark
nicknamed
ratslayer
presented
himself
before
the
procurator
ratslayer
was
a
head
taller
than
the
tallest
soldier
of
the
legion
and
so
broad
in
the
shoulders
that
he
completely
blocked
out
the
stilllow
sun
the
procurator
addressed
the
centurion
in
latin
the
criminal
calls
me
good
man
take
him
outside
for
a
moment
explain
to
him
how
i
ought
to
be
spoken
to
but
no
maiming
and
everyone
except
the
motionless
procurator
followed
mark
ratslayer
with
their
eyes
as
he
motioned
to
the
arrested
man
indicating
that
he
should
go
with
him
everyone
generally
followed
ratslayer
with
their
eyes
wherever
he
appeared
because
of
his
height
and
those
who
were
seeing
him
for
the
first
time
also
because
the
centurion
s
face
was
disfigured
his
nose
had
once
been
smashed
by
a
blow
from
a
germanic
club
mark
s
heavy
boots
thudded
across
the
mosaic
the
bound
man
noiselessly
went
out
with
him
complete
silence
fell
in
the
colonnade
and
one
could
hear
pigeons
cooing
on
the
garden
terrace
near
the
balcony
and
water
singing
an
intricate
pleasant
song
in
the
fountain
the
procurator
would
have
liked
to
get
up
put
his
temple
under
the
spout
and
stay
standing
that
way
but
he
knew
that
even
that
would
not
help
him
having
brought
the
arrested
man
from
under
the
columns
out
to
the
garden
ratslayer
took
a
whip
from
the
hands
of
a
legionary
who
was
standing
at
the
foot
of
a
bronze
statue
and
swinging
easily
struck
the
arrested
man
across
the
shoulders
the
centurion
s
movement
was
casual
and
light
yet
the
bound
man
instantly
collapsed
on
the
ground
as
if
his
legs
had
been
cut
from
under
him
he
gasped
for
air
the
colour
drained
from
his
face
and
his
eyes
went
vacant
with
his
left
hand
only
mark
heaved
the
fallen
man
into
the
air
like
an
empty
sack
set
him
on
his
feet
and
spoke
nasally
in
poorly
pronounced
aramaic
the
roman
procurator
is
called
hegemon
use
no
other
words
stand
at
attention
do
you
understand
me
or
do
i
hit
you
the
arrested
man
swayed
but
got
hold
of
himself
his
colour
returned
he
caught
his
breath
and
answered
hoarsely
i
understand
don
t
beat
me
a
moment
later
he
was
again
standing
before
the
procurator
a
lustreless
sick
voice
sounded
name
mine
the
arrested
man
hastily
responded
his
whole
being
expressing
a
readiness
to
answer
sensibly
without
provoking
further
wrath
the
procurator
said
softly
i
know
my
own
don
t
pretend
to
be
stupider
than
you
are
yours
yeshua
the
prisoner
replied
promptly
any
surname
hanozri
where
do
you
come
from
the
town
of
gamala
replied
the
prisoner
indicating
with
his
head
that
there
somewhere
far
off
to
his
right
in
the
north
was
the
town
of
gamala
who
are
you
by
blood
i
don
t
know
exactly
the
arrested
man
replied
animatedly
i
don
t
remember
my
parents
i
was
told
that
my
father
was
a
syrian
where
is
your
permanent
residence
i
have
no
permanent
home
the
prisoner
answered
shyly
i
travel
from
town
to
town
that
can
be
put
more
briefly
in
a
word
a
vagrant
the
procurator
said
and
asked
any
family
none
i
m
alone
in
the
world
can
you
read
and
write
yes
do
you
know
any
language
besides
aramaic
yes
greek
a
swollen
eyelid
rose
an
eye
clouded
with
suffering
fixed
the
arrested
man
the
other
eye
remained
shut
pilate
spoke
in
greek
so
it
was
you
who
was
going
to
destroy
the
temple
building
and
called
on
the
people
to
do
that
here
the
prisoner
again
became
animated
his
eyes
ceased
to
show
fear
and
he
spoke
in
greek
never
goo
here
terror
flashed
in
the
prisoner
s
eyes
because
he
had
nearly
made
a
slip
never
hegemon
never
in
my
life
was
i
going
to
destroy
the
temple
building
nor
did
i
incite
anyone
to
this
senseless
act
surprise
showed
on
the
face
of
the
secretary
hunched
over
a
low
table
and
writing
down
the
testimony
he
raised
his
head
but
immediately
bent
it
to
the
parchment
again
all
sorts
of
people
gather
in
this
town
for
the
feast
among
them
there
are
magicians
astrologers
diviners
and
murderers
the
procurator
spoke
in
monotone
and
occasionally
also
liars
you
for
instance
are
a
liar
it
is
written
clearly
incited
to
destroy
the
temple
people
have
testified
to
it
these
good
people
the
prisoner
spoke
and
hastily
adding
hegemon
went
on
haven
t
any
learning
and
have
confused
everything
i
told
them
generally
i
m
beginning
to
be
afraid
that
this
confusion
may
go
on
for
a
very
long
time
and
all
because
he
writes
down
the
things
i
sayincorrectly
silence
fell
by
now
both
sick
eyes
rested
heavily
on
the
prisoner
i
repeat
to
you
but
for
the
last
time
stop
pretending
that
you
re
a
madman
robber
pilate
said
softly
and
monotonously
there
s
not
much
written
in
your
record
but
what
there
is
is
enough
to
hang
you
no
no
hegemon
the
arrested
man
said
straining
all
over
in
his
wish
to
convince
there
s
one
with
a
goatskin
parchment
who
follows
me
follows
me
and
keeps
writing
all
the
time
but
once
i
peeked
into
this
parchment
and
was
horrified
i
said
decidedly
nothing
of
what
s
written
there
i
implored
him
burn
your
parchment
i
beg
you
but
he
tore
it
out
of
my
hands
and
ran
away
who
is
that
pilate
asked
squeamishly
and
touched
his
temple
with
his
hand
matthew
levi
the
prisoner
explained
willingly
he
used
to
be
a
tax
collector
and
i
first
met
him
on
the
road
in
bethphage
where
a
fig
grove
juts
out
at
an
angle
and
i
got
to
talking
with
him
he
treated
me
hostilely
at
first
and
even
insulted
me
that
is
thought
he
insulted
me
by
calling
me
a
dog
here
the
prisoner
smiled
i
personally
see
nothing
bad
about
this
animal
that
i
should
be
offended
by
this
word
the
secretary
stopped
writing
and
stealthily
cast
a
surprised
glance
not
at
the
arrested
man
but
at
the
procurator
however
after
listening
to
me
he
began
to
soften
yeshua
went
on
finally
threw
the
money
down
in
the
road
and
said
he
would
go
journeying
with
me
pilate
grinned
with
one
cheek
baring
yellow
teeth
and
said
turning
his
whole
body
towards
the
secretary
oh
city
of
yershalaim
what
does
one
not
hear
in
it
a
tax
collector
do
you
hear
threw
money
down
in
the
road
not
knowing
how
to
reply
to
that
the
secretary
found
it
necessary
to
repeat
pilate
s
smile
he
said
that
henceforth
money
had
become
hateful
to
him
yeshua
explained
matthew
levi
s
strange
action
and
added
and
since
then
he
has
been
my
companion
his
teeth
still
bared
the
procurator
glanced
at
the
arrested
man
then
at
the
sun
steadily
rising
over
the
equestrian
statues
of
the
hippodrome
which
lay
far
below
to
the
right
and
suddenly
in
some
sickening
anguish
thought
that
the
simplest
thing
would
be
to
drive
this
strange
robber
off
the
balcony
by
uttering
just
two
words
hang
him
to
drive
the
convoy
away
as
well
to
leave
the
colonnade
go
into
the
palace
order
the
room
darkened
collapse
on
the
bed
send
for
cold
water
call
in
a
plaintive
voice
for
his
dog
banga
and
complain
to
him
about
the
hemicrania
and
the
thought
of
poison
suddenly
flashed
temptingly
in
the
procurator
s
sick
head
he
gazed
with
dull
eyes
at
the
arrested
man
and
was
silent
for
a
time
painfully
trying
to
remember
why
there
stood
before
him
in
the
pitiless
morning
sunlight
of
yershalaim
this
prisoner
with
his
face
disfigured
by
beating
and
what
other
utterly
unnecessary
questions
he
had
to
ask
him
matthew
levi
the
sick
man
asked
in
a
hoarse
voice
and
dosed
his
eyes
yes
matthew
levi
the
high
tormenting
voice
came
to
him
and
what
was
it
in
any
case
that
you
said
about
the
temple
to
the
crowd
in
the
bazaar
the
responding
voice
seemed
to
stab
at
pilate
s
temple
was
inexpressibly
painful
and
this
voice
was
saying
i
said
hegemon
that
the
temple
of
the
old
faith
would
fall
and
a
new
temple
of
truth
would
be
built
i
said
it
that
way
so
as
to
make
it
more
understandable
and
why
did
you
stir
up
the
people
in
the
bazaar
you
vagrant
talking
about
the
truth
of
which
you
have
no
notion
what
is
truth
and
here
the
procurator
thought
oh
my
gods
i
m
asking
him
about
something
unnecessary
at
a
trial
my
reason
no
longer
serves
me
and
again
he
pictured
a
cup
of
dark
liquid
poison
bring
me
poison
and
again
he
heard
the
voice
the
truth
is
first
of
all
that
your
head
aches
and
aches
so
badly
that
you
re
having
fainthearted
thoughts
of
death
you
re
not
only
unable
to
speak
to
me
but
it
is
even
hard
for
you
to
look
at
me
and
i
am
now
your
unwilling
torturer
which
upsets
me
you
can
t
even
think
about
anything
and
only
dream
that
your
dog
should
come
apparently
the
one
being
you
are
attached
to
but
your
suffering
will
soon
be
over
your
headache
will
go
away
the
secretary
goggled
his
eyes
at
the
prisoner
and
stopped
writing
in
midword
pilate
raised
his
tormented
eyes
to
the
prisoner
and
saw
that
the
sun
already
stood
quite
high
over
the
hippodrome
that
a
ray
had
penetrated
the
colonnade
and
was
stealing
towards
yeshua
s
worn
sandals
and
that
the
man
was
trying
to
step
out
of
the
sun
s
way
here
the
procurator
rose
from
his
chair
clutched
his
head
with
his
hands
and
his
yellowish
shaven
face
expressed
dread
but
he
instantly
suppressed
it
with
his
will
and
lowered
himself
into
his
chair
again
the
prisoner
meanwhile
continued
his
speech
but
the
secretary
was
no
longer
writing
it
down
and
only
stretched
his
neck
like
a
goose
trying
not
to
let
drop
a
single
word
well
there
it
s
all
over
the
arrested
man
said
glancing
benevolently
at
pilate
and
i
m
extremely
glad
of
it
i
d
advise
you
hegemon
to
leave
the
palace
for
a
while
and
go
for
a
stroll
somewhere
in
the
vicinity
say
in
the
gardens
on
the
mount
of
olives
a
storm
will
come
the
prisoner
turned
narrowing
his
eyes
at
the
sun
later
on
towards
evening
a
stroll
would
do
you
much
good
and
i
would
be
glad
to
accompany
you
certain
new
thoughts
have
occurred
to
me
which
i
think
you
might
find
interesting
and
i
d
willingly
share
them
with
you
the
more
so
as
you
give
the
impression
of
being
a
very
intelligent
man
the
secretary
turned
deathly
pale
and
dropped
the
scroll
on
the
floor
the
trouble
is
the
bound
man
went
on
not
stopped
by
anyone
that
you
are
too
closed
off
and
have
definitively
lost
faith
in
people
you
must
agree
one
can
t
place
all
one
s
affection
in
a
dog
your
life
is
impoverished
hegemon
and
here
the
speaker
allowed
himself
to
smile
the
secretary
now
thought
of
only
one
thing
whether
to
believe
his
ears
or
not
he
had
to
believe
then
he
tried
to
imagine
precisely
what
whimsical
form
the
wrath
of
the
hottempered
procurator
would
take
at
this
unheardof
impudence
from
the
prisoner
and
this
the
secretary
was
unable
to
imagine
though
he
knew
the
procurator
well
then
came
the
cracked
hoarse
voice
of
the
procurator
who
said
in
latin
unbind
his
hands
one
of
the
convoy
legionaries
rapped
with
his
spear
handed
it
to
another
went
over
and
took
the
ropes
off
the
prisoner
the
secretary
picked
up
his
scroll
having
decided
to
record
nothing
for
now
and
to
be
surprised
at
nothing
admit
pilate
asked
softly
in
greek
that
you
are
a
great
physician
no
procurator
i
am
not
a
physician
the
prisoner
replied
delightedly
rubbing
a
crimped
and
swollen
purple
wrist
scowling
deeply
pilate
bored
the
prisoner
with
his
eyes
and
these
eyes
were
no
longer
dull
but
flashed
with
sparks
familiar
to
all
i
didn
t
ask
you
pilate
said
maybe
you
also
know
latin
yes
i
do
the
prisoner
replied
colour
came
to
pilate
s
yellowish
cheeks
and
he
asked
in
latin
how
did
you
know
i
wanted
to
call
my
dog
it
s
very
simple
the
prisoner
replied
in
latin
you
were
moving
your
hand
in
the
air
and
the
prisoner
repeated
pilate
s
gesture
as
if
you
wanted
to
stroke
something
and
your
lips
yes
said
pilate
there
was
silence
then
pilate
asked
a
question
in
greek
and
so
you
are
a
physician
no
no
the
prisoner
replied
animatedly
believe
me
i
m
not
a
physician
very
well
then
if
you
want
to
keep
it
a
secret
do
so
it
has
no
direct
bearing
on
the
case
so
you
maintain
that
you
did
not
incite
anyone
to
destroy
or
set
fire
to
or
in
any
other
way
demolish
the
temple
i
repeat
i
did
not
incite
anyone
to
such
acts
hegemon
do
i
look
like
a
halfwit
oh
no
you
don
t
look
like
a
halfwit
the
procurator
replied
quietly
and
smiled
some
strange
smile
swear
then
that
it
wasn
t
so
by
what
do
you
want
me
to
swear
the
unbound
man
asked
very
animated
well
let
s
say
by
your
life
the
procurator
replied
it
s
high
time
you
swore
by
it
since
it
s
hanging
by
a
hair
i
can
tell
you
you
don
t
think
it
was
you
who
hung
it
hegemon
the
prisoner
asked
if
so
you
are
very
mistaken
pilate
gave
a
start
and
replied
through
his
teeth
i
can
cut
that
hair
in
that
too
you
are
mistaken
the
prisoner
retorted
smiling
brightly
and
shielding
himself
from
the
sun
with
his
hand
you
must
agree
that
surely
only
he
who
hung
it
can
cut
the
hair
so
so
pilate
said
smiling
now
i
have
no
doubts
that
the
idle
loafers
of
yershalaim
followed
at
your
heels
i
don
t
know
who
hung
such
a
tongue
on
you
but
he
hung
it
well
incidentally
tell
me
is
it
true
that
you
entered
yershalaim
by
the
susa
gate
riding
on
an
ass
accompanied
by
a
crowd
of
riffraff
who
shouted
greetings
to
you
as
some
kind
of
prophet
here
the
procurator
pointed
to
the
parchment
scroll
the
prisoner
glanced
at
the
procurator
in
perplexity
i
don
t
even
have
an
ass
hegemon
he
said
i
did
enter
yershalaim
by
the
susa
gate
but
on
foot
accompanied
only
by
matthew
levi
and
no
one
shouted
anything
to
me
because
no
one
in
yershalaim
knew
me
then
do
you
happen
to
know
pilate
continued
without
taking
his
eyes
off
the
prisoner
such
men
as
a
certain
dysmas
another
named
gestas
and
a
third
named
barrabban
i
do
not
know
these
good
people
the
prisoner
replied
truly
truly
and
now
tell
me
why
is
it
that
you
use
the
words
good
people
all
the
time
do
you
call
everyone
that
or
what
everyone
the
prisoner
replied
there
are
no
evil
people
in
the
world
the
first
i
hear
of
it
pilate
said
grinning
but
perhaps
i
know
too
little
of
life
you
needn
t
record
any
more
he
addressed
the
secretary
who
had
not
recorded
anything
anyway
and
went
on
talking
with
the
prisoner
you
read
that
in
some
greek
book
no
i
figured
it
out
for
myself
and
you
preach
it
yes
but
take
for
instance
the
centurion
mark
the
one
known
as
ratslayer
is
he
good
yes
replied
the
prisoner
true
he
s
an
unhappy
man
since
the
good
people
disfigured
him
he
has
become
cruel
and
hard
i
d
be
curious
to
know
who
maimed
him
i
can
willingly
tell
you
that
pilate
responded
for
i
was
a
witness
to
it
the
good
people
fell
on
him
like
dogs
on
a
bear
there
were
germani
fastened
on
his
neck
his
arms
his
legs
the
infantry
maniple
was
encircled
and
if
one
flank
hadn
t
been
cut
by
a
cavalry
turm
of
which
i
wasthe
commander
you
philosopher
would
not
have
had
the
chance
to
speak
with
the
ratslayer
that
was
at
the
battle
of
idistaviso
in
the
valley
of
the
virgins
if
i
could
speak
with
him
the
prisoner
suddenly
said
musingly
i
m
sure
he
d
change
sharply
i
don
t
suppose
pilate
responded
that
you
d
bring
much
joy
to
the
legate
of
the
legion
if
you
decided
to
talk
with
any
of
his
officers
or
soldiers
anyhow
it
s
also
not
going
to
happen
fortunately
for
everyone
and
i
will
be
the
first
to
see
to
it
at
that
moment
a
swallow
swiftly
flitted
into
the
colonnade
described
a
circle
under
the
golden
ceiling
swooped
down
almost
brushed
the
face
of
a
bronze
statue
in
a
niche
with
its
pointed
wing
and
disappeared
behind
the
capital
of
a
column
it
may
be
that
it
thought
of
nesting
there
during
its
flight
a
formula
took
shape
in
the
now
light
and
lucid
head
of
the
procurator
it
went
like
this
the
hegemon
has
looked
into
the
case
of
the
vagrant
philosopher
yeshua
alias
hanozri
and
found
in
it
no
grounds
for
indictment
in
particular
he
has
found
not
the
slightest
connection
between
the
acts
of
yeshua
and
the
disorders
that
have
lately
taken
place
in
yershalaim
the
vagrant
philosopher
has
proved
to
be
mentally
ill
consequently
the
procurator
has
not
confirmed
the
death
sentence
on
hanozri
passed
by
the
lesser
sanhedrin
but
seeing
that
hanozri
s
mad
utopian
talk
might
cause
disturbances
in
yershalaim
the
procurator
is
removing
yeshua
from
yershalaim
and
putting
him
under
confinement
in
stratonian
caesarea
on
the
mediterranean
that
is
precisely
where
the
procurator
s
residence
was
it
remained
to
dictate
it
to
the
secretary
the
swallow
s
wings
whiffled
right
over
the
hegemon
s
head
the
bird
darted
to
the
fountain
basin
and
then
flew
out
into
freedom
the
procurator
raised
his
eyes
to
the
prisoner
and
saw
the
dust
blaze
up
in
a
pillar
around
him
is
that
all
about
him
pilate
asked
the
secretary
unfortunately
not
the
secretary
replied
unexpectedly
and
handed
pilate
another
piece
of
parchment
what
s
this
now
pilate
asked
and
frowned
having
read
what
had
been
handed
to
him
he
changed
countenance
even
more
either
the
dark
blood
rose
to
his
neck
and
face
or
something
else
happened
only
his
skin
lost
its
yellow
tinge
turned
brown
and
his
eyes
seemed
to
sink
again
it
was
probably
owing
to
the
blood
rising
to
his
temples
and
throbbing
in
them
only
something
happened
to
the
procurator
s
vision
thus
he
imagined
that
the
prisoner
s
head
floated
off
somewhere
and
another
appeared
in
its
place
on
this
bald
head
sat
a
scantpointed
golden
diadem
on
the
forehead
was
a
round
canker
eating
into
the
skin
and
smeared
with
ointment
a
sunken
toothless
mouth
with
a
pendulous
capricious
lower
lip
it
seemed
to
pilate
that
the
pink
columns
of
the
balcony
and
the
rooftops
of
yershalaim
far
below
beyond
the
garden
vanished
and
everything
was
drowned
in
the
thickest
green
of
caprean
gardens
and
something
strange
also
happened
to
his
hearing
it
was
as
if
trumpets
sounded
far
away
muted
and
menacing
and
a
nasal
voice
was
very
clearly
heard
arrogantly
drawling
the
law
of
lesemajesty
thoughts
raced
short
incoherent
and
extraordinary
i
m
lost
then
we
re
lost
and
among
them
a
totally
absurd
one
about
some
immortality
which
immortality
for
some
reason
provoked
unendurable
anguish
pilate
strained
drove
the
apparition
away
his
gaze
returned
to
the
balcony
and
again
the
prisoner
s
eyes
were
before
him
listen
hanozri
the
procurator
spoke
looking
at
yeshua
somehow
strangely
the
procurator
s
face
was
menacing
but
his
eyes
were
alarmed
did
you
ever
say
anything
about
the
great
caesar
answer
did
you
yes
or
no
pilate
drew
the
word
no
out
somewhat
longer
than
is
done
in
court
and
his
glance
sent
yeshua
some
thought
that
he
wished
as
if
to
instil
in
the
prisoner
to
speak
the
truth
is
easy
and
pleasant
the
prisoner
observed
i
have
no
need
to
know
pilate
responded
in
a
stifled
angry
voice
whether
it
is
pleasant
or
unpleasant
for
you
to
speak
the
truth
you
will
have
to
speak
it
anyway
but
as
you
speak
weigh
every
word
unless
you
want
a
not
only
inevitable
but
also
painful
death
no
one
knew
what
had
happened
with
the
procurator
of
judea
but
he
allowed
himself
to
raise
his
hand
as
if
to
protect
himself
from
a
ray
of
sunlight
and
from
behind
his
hand
as
from
behind
a
shield
to
send
the
prisoner
some
sort
of
prompting
look
answer
then
he
went
on
speaking
do
you
know
a
certain
judas
from
kiriath
and
what
precisely
did
you
say
to
him
about
caesar
if
you
said
anything
it
was
like
this
the
prisoner
began
talking
eagerly
the
evening
before
last
near
the
temple
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
young
man
who
called
himself
judas
from
the
town
of
kiriath
he
invited
me
to
his
place
in
the
lower
city
and
treated
me
to
a
good
man
pilate
asked
and
a
devilish
fire
flashed
in
his
eyes
a
very
good
man
and
an
inquisitive
one
the
prisoner
confirmed
he
showed
the
greatest
interest
in
my
thoughts
and
received
me
very
cordially
lit
the
lamps
pilate
spoke
through
his
teeth
in
the
same
tone
as
the
prisoner
and
his
eyes
glinted
yes
yeshua
went
on
slightly
surprised
that
the
procurator
was
so
well
informed
and
asked
me
to
give
my
view
of
state
authority
he
was
extremely
interested
in
this
question
and
what
did
you
say
asked
pilate
or
are
you
going
to
reply
that
you
ve
forgotten
what
you
said
but
there
was
already
hopelessness
in
pilate
s
tone
among
other
things
the
prisoner
recounted
i
said
that
all
authority
is
violence
over
people
and
that
a
time
will
come
when
there
will
be
no
authority
of
the
caesars
nor
any
other
authority
man
will
pass
into
the
kingdom
of
truth
and
justice
where
generally
there
will
be
no
need
for
any
authority
go
on
i
didn
t
go
on
said
the
prisoner
here
men
ran
in
bound
me
and
took
me
away
to
prison
the
secretary
trying
not
to
let
drop
a
single
word
rapidly
traced
the
words
on
his
parchment
there
never
has
been
is
not
and
never
will
be
any
authority
in
this
world
greater
or
better
for
people
than
the
authority
of
the
emperor
tiberius
pilate
s
cracked
and
sick
voice
swelled
for
some
reason
the
procurator
looked
at
the
secretary
and
the
convoy
with
hatred
and
it
is
not
for
you
insane
criminal
to
reason
about
it
here
pilate
shouted
convoy
off
the
balcony
and
turning
to
the
secretary
he
added
leave
me
alone
with
the
criminal
this
is
a
state
matter
the
convoy
raised
their
spears
and
with
a
measured
tramp
of
hobnailed
caligae
walked
off
the
balcony
into
the
garden
and
the
secretary
followed
the
convoy
for
some
time
the
silence
on
the
balcony
was
broken
only
by
the
water
singing
in
the
fountain
pilate
saw
how
the
watery
dish
blew
up
over
the
spout
how
its
edges
broke
off
how
it
fell
down
in
streams
the
prisoner
was
the
first
to
speak
i
see
that
some
misfortune
has
come
about
because
i
talked
with
that
young
man
from
kiriath
i
have
a
foreboding
hegemon
that
he
will
come
to
grief
and
i
am
very
sorry
for
him
i
think
the
procurator
replied
grinning
strangely
that
there
is
now
someone
else
in
the
world
for
whom
you
ought
to
feel
sorrier
than
for
judas
of
kiriath
and
who
is
going
to
have
it
much
worse
than
judas
so
then
mark
ratslayer
a
cold
and
convinced
torturer
the
people
who
as
i
see
the
procurator
pointed
to
yeshua
s
disfigured
face
beat
you
for
your
preaching
the
robbers
dysmas
and
gestas
who
with
their
confrères
killed
four
soldiers
and
finally
the
dirty
traitor
judas
are
all
good
people
yes
said
the
prisoner
and
the
kingdom
of
truth
will
come
it
will
hegemon
yeshua
answered
with
conviction
it
will
never
come
pilate
suddenly
cried
out
in
such
a
terrible
voice
that
yeshua
drew
back
thus
many
years
before
in
the
valley
of
the
virgins
pilate
had
cried
to
his
horsemen
the
words
cut
them
down
cut
them
down
the
giant
ratslayer
is
trapped
he
raised
his
voice
cracked
with
commanding
still
more
and
called
out
so
that
his
words
could
be
heard
in
the
garden
criminal
criminal
criminal
and
then
lowering
his
voice
he
asked
yeshua
hanozri
do
you
believe
in
any
gods
god
is
one
replied
yeshua
i
believe
in
him
then
pray
to
him
pray
hard
however
here
pilate
s
voice
gave
out
that
won
t
help
no
wife
pilate
asked
with
anguish
for
some
reason
not
understanding
what
was
happening
to
him
no
i
m
alone
hateful
city
the
procurator
suddenly
muttered
for
some
reason
shaking
his
shoulders
as
if
he
were
cold
and
rubbing
his
hands
as
though
washing
them
if
they
d
put
a
knife
in
you
before
your
meeting
with
judas
of
kiriath
it
really
would
have
been
better
why
don
t
you
let
me
go
hegemon
the
prisoner
asked
unexpectedly
and
his
voice
became
anxious
i
see
they
want
to
kill
me
a
spasm
contorted
pilate
s
face
he
turned
to
yeshua
the
inflamed
redveined
whites
of
his
eyes
and
said
do
you
suppose
wretch
that
the
roman
procurator
will
let
a
man
go
who
has
said
what
you
have
said
oh
gods
gods
or
do
you
think
i
m
ready
to
take
your
place
i
don
t
share
your
thoughts
and
listen
to
me
if
from
this
moment
on
you
say
even
one
word
if
you
speak
to
anyone
at
all
beware
of
me
i
repeat
to
you
beware
hegemon
silence
cried
pilate
and
his
furious
gaze
followed
the
swallow
that
had
again
fluttered
on
to
the
balcony
to
me
pilate
shouted
and
when
the
secretary
and
the
convoy
returned
to
their
places
pilate
announced
that
he
confirmed
the
death
sentence
passed
at
the
meeting
of
the
lesser
sanhedrin
on
the
criminal
yeshua
hanozri
and
the
secretary
wrote
down
what
pilate
said
a
moment
later
mark
ratslayer
stood
before
the
procurator
the
procurator
ordered
him
to
hand
the
criminal
over
to
the
head
of
the
secret
service
along
with
the
procurator
s
directive
that
yeshua
hanozri
was
to
be
separated
from
the
other
condemned
men
and
also
that
the
soldiers
of
the
secret
service
were
to
be
forbidden
on
pain
of
severe
punishment
to
talk
with
yeshua
about
anything
at
all
or
to
answer
any
of
his
questions
at
a
sign
from
mark
the
convoy
closed
around
yeshua
and
led
him
from
the
balcony
next
there
stood
before
the
procurator
a
handsome
lightbearded
man
with
eagle
feathers
on
the
crest
of
his
helmet
golden
lions
heads
shining
on
his
chest
and
golden
plaques
on
his
sword
belt
wearing
triplesoled
boots
laced
to
the
knees
and
with
a
purple
cloak
thrown
over
his
left
shoulder
this
was
the
legate
in
command
of
the
legion
the
procurator
asked
him
where
the
sebastean
cohort
was
stationed
at
the
moment
the
legate
told
him
that
the
sebasteans
had
cordoned
off
the
square
in
front
of
the
hippodrome
where
the
sentencing
of
the
criminals
was
to
be
announced
to
the
people
then
the
procurator
ordered
the
legate
to
detach
two
centuries
from
the
roman
cohort
one
of
them
under
the
command
of
ratslayer
was
to
convoy
the
criminals
the
carts
with
the
implements
for
the
execution
and
the
executioners
as
they
were
transported
to
bald
mountain
and
on
arrival
was
to
join
the
upper
cordon
the
other
was
to
be
sent
at
once
to
bald
mountain
and
immediately
start
forming
the
cordon
for
the
same
purpose
that
is
to
guard
the
mountain
the
procurator
asked
the
legate
to
send
an
auxiliary
cavalry
regiment
the
syrian
ala
after
the
legate
left
the
balcony
the
procurator
ordered
the
secretary
to
summon
to
the
palace
the
president
of
the
sanhedrin
two
of
its
members
and
the
head
of
the
temple
guard
in
yershalaim
adding
that
he
asked
things
to
be
so
arranged
that
before
conferring
with
all
these
people
he
could
speak
with
the
president
previously
and
alone
the
procurator
s
order
was
executed
quickly
and
precisely
and
the
sun
which
in
those
days
was
scorching
yershalaim
with
an
extraordinary
fierceness
had
not
yet
had
time
to
approach
its
highest
point
when
on
the
upper
terrace
of
the
garden
by
the
two
white
marble
lions
that
guarded
the
stairs
a
meeting
took
place
between
the
procurator
and
the
man
fulfilling
the
duties
of
president
of
the
sanhedrin
the
high
priest
of
the
jews
joseph
kaifa
it
was
quiet
in
the
garden
but
when
he
came
out
from
under
the
colonnade
to
the
sundrenched
upper
level
of
the
garden
with
its
palm
trees
on
monstrous
elephant
legs
from
which
there
spread
before
the
procurator
the
whole
of
hateful
yershalaim
with
its
hanging
bridges
fortresses
and
above
all
that
utterly
indescribable
heap
of
marble
with
golden
dragon
scales
for
a
roof
the
temple
of
yershalaim
the
procurator
s
sharp
ear
caught
far
below
where
the
stone
wall
separated
the
lower
terraces
of
the
palace
garden
from
the
city
square
a
low
rumble
over
which
from
time
to
time
there
soared
feeble
thin
moans
or
cries
the
procurator
understood
that
there
on
the
square
a
numberless
crowd
of
yershalaim
citizens
agitated
by
the
recent
disorders
had
already
gathered
that
this
crowd
was
waiting
impatiently
for
the
announcement
of
the
sentences
and
that
restless
water
sellers
were
crying
in
its
midst
the
procurator
began
by
inviting
the
high
priest
on
to
the
balcony
to
take
shelter
from
the
merciless
heat
but
kaifa
politely
apologized
and
explained
that
he
could
not
do
that
on
the
eve
of
the
feast
pilate
covered
his
slightly
balding
head
with
a
hood
and
began
the
conversation
this
conversation
took
place
in
greek
pilate
said
that
he
had
looked
into
the
case
of
yeshua
hanozri
and
confirmed
the
death
sentence
thus
three
robbers
dysmas
gestas
and
barrabban
and
this
yeshua
hanozri
besides
were
condemned
to
be
executed
and
it
was
to
be
done
that
day
the
first
two
who
had
ventured
to
incite
the
people
to
rebel
against
caesar
had
been
taken
in
armed
struggle
by
the
roman
authorities
were
accounted
to
the
procurator
and
consequently
would
not
be
talked
about
here
but
the
second
two
barrabban
and
hanozri
had
been
seized
by
the
local
authorities
and
condemned
by
the
sanhedrin
according
to
the
law
according
to
custom
one
of
these
two
criminals
had
to
be
released
in
honour
of
the
great
feast
of
passover
which
would
begin
that
dayand
so
the
procurator
wished
to
know
which
of
the
two
criminals
the
sanhedrin
intended
to
set
free
barrabban
or
hanozri
kaifa
inclined
his
head
to
signify
that
the
question
was
clear
to
him
and
replied
the
sanhedrin
asks
that
barrabban
be
released
the
procurator
knew
very
well
that
the
high
priest
would
give
precisely
that
answer
but
his
task
consisted
in
showing
that
this
answer
provoked
his
astonishment
this
pilate
did
with
great
artfulness
the
eyebrows
on
the
arrogant
face
rose
the
procurator
looked
with
amazement
straight
into
the
high
priest
s
eyes
i
confess
this
answer
stuns
me
the
procurator
began
softly
i
m
afraid
there
may
be
some
misunderstanding
here
pilate
explained
himself
roman
authority
does
not
encroach
in
the
least
upon
the
rights
of
the
local
spiritual
authorities
the
high
priest
knows
that
very
well
but
in
the
present
case
we
are
faced
with
an
obvious
error
and
this
error
roman
authority
is
of
course
interested
in
correcting
in
fact
the
crimes
of
barrabban
and
hanozri
are
quite
incomparable
in
their
gravity
if
the
latter
obviously
an
insane
person
is
guilty
of
uttering
preposterous
things
in
yershalaim
and
some
other
places
the
former
s
burden
of
guilt
is
more
considerable
not
only
did
he
allow
himself
to
call
directly
for
rebellion
but
he
also
killed
a
guard
during
the
attempt
to
arrest
him
barrabban
is
incomparably
more
dangerous
than
hanozri
on
the
strength
of
all
the
foregoing
the
procurator
asks
the
high
priest
to
reconsider
the
decision
and
release
the
less
harmful
of
the
two
condemned
men
and
that
is
without
doubt
hanozri
and
so
kaifa
said
in
a
quiet
but
firm
voice
that
the
sanhedrin
had
thoroughly
familiarized
itself
with
the
case
and
informed
him
a
second
time
that
it
intended
to
free
barrabban
what
even
after
my
intercession
the
intercession
of
him
through
whose
person
roman
authority
speaks
repeat
it
a
third
time
high
priest
and
a
third
time
i
repeat
that
we
are
setting
barrabban
free
kaifa
said
softly
it
was
all
over
and
there
was
nothing
more
to
talk
about
hanozri
was
departing
for
ever
and
there
was
no
one
to
cure
the
dreadful
wicked
pains
of
the
procurator
there
was
no
remedy
for
them
except
death
but
it
was
not
this
thought
which
now
struck
pilate
the
same
incomprehensible
anguish
that
had
already
visited
him
on
the
balcony
pierced
his
whole
being
he
tried
at
once
to
explain
it
and
the
explanation
was
a
strange
one
it
seemed
vaguely
to
the
procurator
that
there
was
something
he
had
not
finished
saying
to
the
condemned
man
and
perhaps
something
he
had
not
finished
hearing
pilate
drove
this
thought
away
and
it
flew
off
as
instantly
as
it
had
come
flying
it
flew
off
and
the
anguish
remained
unexplained
for
it
could
not
well
be
explained
by
another
brief
thought
that
flashed
like
lightning
and
at
once
went
out
immortality
immortality
has
come
whose
immortality
had
come
that
the
procurator
did
not
understand
but
the
thought
of
this
enigmatic
immortality
made
him
grow
cold
in
the
scorching
sun
very
well
said
pilate
let
it
be
so
here
he
turned
gazed
around
at
the
world
visible
to
him
and
was
surprised
at
the
change
that
had
taken
place
the
bush
laden
with
roses
had
vanished
vanished
were
the
cypresses
bordering
the
upper
terrace
and
the
pomegranate
tree
and
the
white
statue
amidst
the
greenery
and
the
greenery
itself
in
place
of
it
all
there
floated
some
purple
mass
water
weeds
swayed
in
it
and
began
moving
off
somewhere
and
pilate
himself
began
moving
with
them
he
was
carried
along
now
smothered
and
burned
by
the
most
terrible
wrath
the
wrath
of
impotence
cramped
said
pilate
i
feel
cramped
with
a
cold
moist
hand
he
tore
at
the
clasp
on
the
collar
of
his
cloak
and
it
fell
to
the
sand
it
s
sultry
today
there
s
a
storm
somewhere
kaifa
responded
not
taking
his
eyes
off
the
procurator
s
reddened
face
and
foreseeing
all
the
torments
that
still
lay
ahead
he
thought
oh
what
a
terrible
month
of
nisan
we
re
having
this
year
no
said
pilate
it
s
not
because
of
the
sultriness
i
feel
cramped
with
you
here
kaifa
and
narrowing
his
eyes
pilate
smiled
and
added
watch
out
for
yourself
high
priest
the
high
priest
s
dark
eyes
glinted
and
with
his
face
no
less
artfully
than
the
procurator
had
done
earlier
he
expressed
amazement
what
do
i
hear
procurator
kaifa
replied
proudly
and
calmly
you
threaten
me
after
you
yourself
have
confirmed
the
sentence
passed
can
that
be
we
are
accustomed
to
the
roman
procurator
choosing
his
words
before
he
says
something
what
if
we
should
be
overheard
hegemon
pilate
looked
at
the
high
priest
with
dead
eyes
and
baring
his
teeth
produced
a
smile
what
s
your
trouble
high
priest
who
can
hear
us
where
we
are
now
do
you
think
i
m
like
that
young
vagrant
holy
fool
who
is
to
be
executed
today
am
i
a
boy
kaifa
i
know
what
i
say
and
where
i
say
it
there
is
a
cordon
around
the
garden
a
cordon
around
the
palace
so
that
a
mouse
couldn
t
get
through
any
crack
not
only
a
mouse
but
even
that
one
what
s
his
name
from
the
town
of
kiriath
couldn
t
get
through
incidentally
high
priest
do
you
know
him
yes
if
that
one
got
in
here
he
d
feel
bitterly
sorry
for
himself
in
this
you
will
of
course
believe
me
know
then
that
from
now
on
high
priest
you
will
have
no
peace
neither
you
nor
your
people
and
pilate
pointed
far
off
to
the
right
where
the
temple
blazed
on
high
it
is
i
who
tell
you
so
pontius
pilate
equestrian
of
the
golden
spear
i
know
i
know
the
blackbearded
kaifa
fearlessly
replied
and
his
eyes
flashed
he
raised
his
arm
to
heaven
and
went
on
the
jewish
people
know
that
you
hate
them
with
a
cruel
hatred
and
will
cause
them
much
suffering
but
you
will
not
destroy
them
utterly
god
will
protect
them
he
will
hear
us
the
almighty
caesar
will
hear
he
will
protect
us
from
pilate
the
destroyer
oh
no
pilate
exclaimed
and
he
felt
lighter
and
lighter
with
every
word
there
was
no
more
need
to
pretend
no
more
need
to
choose
his
words
you
have
complained
about
me
too
much
to
caesar
and
now
my
hour
has
come
kaifa
now
the
message
will
fly
from
me
and
not
to
the
governor
in
antioch
and
not
to
rome
but
directly
to
capreae
to
the
emperor
himself
the
message
of
how
you
in
yershalaim
are
sheltering
known
criminals
from
death
and
then
it
will
not
be
water
from
solomon
s
pool
that
i
give
yershalaim
to
drink
as
i
wanted
to
do
for
your
own
good
no
not
water
remember
how
on
account
of
you
i
had
to
remove
the
shields
with
the
emperor
s
insignia
from
the
walls
had
to
transfer
troops
had
as
you
see
to
come
in
person
to
look
into
what
goes
on
with
you
here
remember
my
words
it
is
not
just
one
cohort
that
you
will
see
here
in
yershalaim
high
priest
no
the
whole
fulminata
legion
will
come
under
the
city
walls
the
arabian
cavalry
will
arrive
and
then
you
will
hear
bitter
weeping
and
wailing
you
will
remember
barrabban
then
whom
you
saved
and
you
will
regret
having
sent
to
his
death
a
philosopher
with
his
peaceful
preaching
the
high
priest
s
face
became
covered
with
blotches
his
eyes
burned
like
the
procurator
he
smiled
baring
his
teeth
and
replied
do
you
yourself
believe
what
you
are
saying
now
procurator
no
you
do
not
it
is
not
peace
not
peace
that
the
seducer
of
the
people
of
yershalaim
brought
us
and
you
equestrian
understand
that
perfectly
well
you
wanted
to
release
him
so
that
he
could
disturb
the
people
outrage
the
faithand
bring
the
people
under
roman
swords
but
i
the
high
priest
of
the
jews
as
long
as
i
live
will
not
allow
the
faith
to
be
outraged
and
will
protect
the
people
do
you
hear
pilate
and
kaifa
raised
his
arm
menacingly
listen
procurator
kaifa
fell
silent
and
the
procurator
again
heard
a
noise
as
if
of
the
sea
rolling
up
to
the
very
walls
of
the
garden
of
herod
the
great
the
noise
rose
from
below
to
the
feet
and
into
the
face
of
the
procurator
and
behind
his
back
there
beyond
the
wings
of
the
palace
came
alarming
trumpet
calls
the
heavy
crunch
of
hundreds
of
feet
the
clanking
of
iron
the
procurator
understood
that
the
roman
infantry
was
already
setting
out
on
his
orders
speeding
to
the
parade
of
death
so
terrible
for
rebels
and
robbers
do
you
hear
procurator
the
high
priest
repeated
quietly
are
you
going
to
tell
me
that
all
this
here
the
high
priest
raised
both
arms
and
the
dark
hood
fell
from
his
head
as
been
caused
by
the
wretched
robber
barrabban
the
procurator
wiped
his
wet
cold
forehead
with
the
back
of
his
hand
looked
at
the
ground
then
squinting
at
the
sky
saw
that
the
redhot
ball
was
almost
over
his
head
and
that
kaifa
s
shadow
had
shrunk
to
nothing
by
the
lion
s
tail
and
said
quietly
and
indifferently
it
s
nearly
noon
we
got
carried
away
by
our
conversation
and
yet
we
must
proceed
having
apologized
in
refined
terms
before
the
high
priest
he
invited
him
to
sit
down
on
a
bench
in
the
shade
of
a
magnolia
and
wait
until
he
summoned
the
other
persons
needed
for
the
last
brief
conference
and
gave
one
more
instruction
connected
with
the
execution
kaifa
bowed
politely
placing
his
hand
on
his
heart
and
stayed
in
the
garden
while
pilate
returned
to
the
balcony
there
he
told
the
secretary
who
had
been
waiting
for
him
to
invite
to
the
garden
the
legate
of
the
legion
and
the
tribune
of
the
cohort
as
well
as
the
two
members
of
the
sanhedrin
and
the
head
of
the
temple
guard
who
had
been
awaiting
his
summons
on
the
lower
garden
terrace
in
a
round
gazebo
with
a
fountain
to
this
pilate
added
that
he
himself
would
come
out
to
the
garden
at
once
and
withdrew
into
the
palace
while
the
secretary
was
gathering
the
conference
the
procurator
met
in
a
room
shielded
from
the
sun
by
dark
curtains
with
a
certain
man
whose
face
was
half
covered
by
a
hood
though
he
could
not
have
been
bothered
by
the
sun
s
rays
in
this
room
the
meeting
was
a
very
short
one
the
procurator
quietly
spoke
a
few
words
to
the
man
after
which
he
withdrew
and
pilate
walked
out
through
the
colonnade
to
the
garden
there
in
the
presence
of
all
those
he
had
desired
to
see
the
procurator
solemnly
and
drily
stated
that
he
confirmed
the
death
sentence
on
yeshua
hanozri
and
officially
inquired
of
the
members
of
the
sanhedrin
as
to
whom
among
the
criminals
they
would
like
to
grant
life
having
received
the
reply
that
it
was
barrabban
the
procurator
said
very
well
and
told
the
secretary
to
put
it
into
the
record
at
once
clutched
in
his
hand
the
clasp
that
the
secretary
had
picked
up
from
the
sand
and
said
solemnly
it
is
time
here
all
those
present
started
down
the
wide
marble
stairway
between
walls
of
roses
that
exuded
a
stupefying
aroma
descending
lower
and
lower
towards
the
palace
wall
to
the
gates
opening
on
to
the
big
smoothly
paved
square
at
the
end
of
which
could
be
seen
the
columns
and
statues
of
the
yershalaim
stadium
as
soon
as
the
group
entered
the
square
from
the
garden
and
mounted
the
spacious
stone
platform
that
dominated
the
square
pilate
looking
around
through
narrowed
eyelids
assessed
the
situation
the
space
he
had
just
traversed
that
is
the
space
from
the
palace
wall
to
the
platform
was
empty
but
before
him
pilate
could
no
longer
see
the
square
it
had
been
swallowed
up
by
the
crowd
which
would
have
poured
over
the
platform
and
the
cleared
space
as
well
had
it
not
been
kept
at
bay
by
a
triple
row
of
sebastean
soldiers
to
the
left
of
pilate
and
soldiers
of
the
auxiliary
iturean
cohort
to
his
right
and
so
pilate
mounted
the
platform
mechanically
clutching
the
useless
clasp
in
his
fist
and
squinting
his
eyes
the
procurator
was
squinting
not
because
the
sun
burned
his
eyes
no
for
some
reason
he
did
not
want
to
see
the
group
of
condemned
men
who
as
he
knew
perfectly
well
were
now
being
brought
on
to
the
platform
behind
him
as
soon
as
the
white
cloak
with
crimson
lining
appeared
high
up
on
the
stone
cliff
over
the
verge
of
the
human
sea
the
unseeing
pilate
was
struck
in
the
ears
by
a
wave
of
sound
haaa
it
started
mutedly
arising
somewhere
far
away
by
the
hippodrome
then
became
thunderous
and
having
held
out
for
a
few
seconds
began
to
subside
they
ve
seen
me
the
procurator
thought
the
wave
had
not
reached
its
lowest
point
before
it
started
swelling
again
unexpectedlyand
swaying
rose
higher
than
the
first
and
as
foam
boils
up
on
the
billows
of
the
sea
so
a
whistling
boiled
up
on
this
second
wave
and
separate
distinguishable
from
the
thunder
the
wails
of
women
they
ve
been
led
on
to
the
platform
thought
pilate
and
the
wails
mean
that
severalwomen
got
crushed
as
the
crowd
surged
forward
he
waited
for
some
time
knowing
that
no
power
could
silence
the
crowd
before
it
exhaled
all
that
was
pent
up
in
it
and
fell
silent
of
itself
and
when
this
moment
came
the
procurator
threw
up
his
right
arm
and
the
last
noise
was
blown
away
from
the
crowd
then
pilate
drew
into
his
breast
as
much
of
the
hot
air
as
he
could
and
shouted
and
his
cracked
voice
carried
over
thousands
of
heads
in
the
name
of
the
emperor
caesar
here
his
ears
were
struck
several
times
by
a
clipped
iron
shout
the
cohorts
of
soldiers
raised
high
their
spears
and
standards
and
shouted
out
terribly
long
live
caesar
pilate
lifted
his
face
and
thrust
it
straight
into
the
sun
green
fire
flared
up
behind
his
eyelids
his
brain
took
flame
from
it
and
hoarse
aramaic
words
went
flying
over
the
crowd
four
criminals
arrested
in
yershalaim
for
murder
incitement
to
rebellion
and
outrages
against
the
laws
and
the
faith
have
been
sentenced
to
a
shameful
execution
by
hanging
on
posts
and
this
execution
will
presently
be
carried
out
on
bald
mountain
the
names
of
the
criminals
are
dysmas
gestas
barrabban
and
hanozri
here
they
stand
before
you
pilate
pointed
to
his
right
not
seeing
any
criminals
but
knowing
they
were
there
in
place
where
they
ought
to
be
the
crowd
responded
with
a
long
rumble
as
if
of
surprise
or
relief
when
it
died
down
pilate
continued
but
only
three
of
them
will
be
executed
for
in
accordance
with
law
and
custom
in
honour
of
the
feast
of
passover
to
one
of
the
condemned
as
chosen
by
the
lesser
sanhedrin
and
confirmed
by
roman
authority
the
magnanimous
emperor
caesar
will
return
his
contemptible
life
pilate
cried
out
the
words
and
at
the
same
time
listened
as
the
rumble
was
replaced
by
a
great
silence
not
a
sigh
not
a
rustle
reached
his
ears
now
and
there
was
even
a
moment
when
it
seemed
to
pilate
that
everything
around
him
had
vanished
altogether
the
hated
city
died
and
he
alone
is
standing
there
scorched
by
the
sheer
rays
his
face
set
against
the
sky
pilate
held
the
silence
a
little
longer
and
then
began
to
cry
out
the
name
of
the
one
who
will
now
be
set
free
before
you
is
he
made
one
more
pause
holding
back
the
name
making
sure
he
had
said
all
because
he
knew
that
the
dead
city
would
resurrect
once
the
name
of
the
lucky
man
was
spoken
and
no
further
words
would
be
heard
all
pilate
whispered
soundlessly
to
himself
all
the
name
and
rolling
the
letter
r
over
the
silent
city
he
cried
barrabban
here
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
sun
clanging
burst
over
him
and
flooded
his
ears
with
fire
this
fire
raged
with
roars
shrieks
wails
guffaws
and
whistles
pilate
turned
and
walked
back
across
the
platform
to
the
stairs
looking
at
nothing
except
the
multicoloured
squares
of
the
flooring
under
his
feet
so
as
not
to
trip
he
knew
that
behind
his
back
the
platform
was
being
showered
with
bronze
coins
dates
that
people
in
the
howling
mob
were
climbing
on
shoulders
crushing
each
other
to
see
the
miracle
with
their
own
eyes
how
a
man
already
in
the
grip
of
death
escaped
that
grip
how
the
legionaries
take
the
ropes
off
him
involuntarily
causing
him
burning
pain
in
his
arms
dislocated
during
his
interrogation
how
he
wincing
and
groaning
nevertheless
smiles
a
senseless
crazed
smile
he
knew
that
at
the
same
time
the
convoy
was
already
leading
the
three
men
with
bound
arms
to
the
side
stairs
so
as
to
take
them
to
the
road
going
west
from
the
city
towards
bald
mountain
only
when
he
was
off
the
platform
to
the
rear
of
it
did
pilate
open
his
eyes
knowing
that
he
was
now
safe
he
could
no
longer
see
the
condemned
men
mingled
with
the
wails
of
the
quieting
crowd
yet
distinguishable
from
them
were
the
piercing
cries
of
heralds
repeating
some
in
aramaic
others
in
greek
all
that
the
procurator
had
cried
out
from
the
platform
besides
that
there
came
to
his
ears
the
tapping
clattering
and
approaching
thud
of
hoofs
and
a
trumpet
calling
out
something
brief
and
merry
these
sounds
were
answered
by
the
drilling
whistles
of
boys
on
the
roofs
of
houses
along
the
street
that
led
from
the
bazaar
to
the
hippodrome
square
and
by
cries
of
look
out
a
soldier
standing
alone
in
the
cleared
space
of
the
square
with
a
standard
in
his
hand
waved
it
anxiously
and
then
the
procurator
the
legate
of
the
legion
the
secretary
and
the
convoy
stopped
a
cavalry
ala
at
an
everlengthening
trot
flew
out
into
the
square
so
as
to
cross
it
at
one
side
bypassing
the
mass
of
people
and
ride
down
a
lane
under
a
stone
wall
covered
with
creeping
vines
taking
the
shortest
route
to
bald
mountain
at
a
flying
trot
small
as
a
boy
dark
as
a
mulatto
the
commander
of
the
ala
a
syrian
coming
abreast
of
pilate
shouted
something
in
a
high
voice
and
snatched
his
sword
from
its
sheath
the
angry
sweating
black
horse
shied
and
reared
thrusting
his
sword
back
into
its
sheath
the
commander
struck
the
horse
s
neck
with
his
crop
brought
him
down
and
rode
off
into
the
lane
breaking
into
a
gallop
after
him
three
by
three
horsemen
flew
in
a
cloud
of
dust
the
tips
of
their
light
bamboo
lances
bobbing
and
faces
dashed
past
the
procurator
looking
especially
swarthy
under
their
white
turbans
with
merrily
bared
gleaming
teeth
raising
dust
to
the
sky
the
ala
burst
into
the
lane
and
the
last
to
ride
past
pilate
was
a
soldier
with
a
trumpet
slung
on
his
back
blazing
in
the
sun
shielding
himself
from
the
dust
with
his
hand
and
wrinkling
his
face
discontentedly
pilate
started
on
in
the
direction
of
the
gates
to
the
palace
garden
and
after
him
came
the
legate
the
secretary
and
the
convoy
it
was
around
ten
o
clock
in
the
morning
chapter
the
seventh
proof
yes
it
was
around
ten
o
clock
in
the
morning
my
esteemed
ivan
nikolaevich
said
the
professor
the
poet
passed
his
hand
over
his
face
like
a
man
just
coming
to
his
senses
and
saw
that
it
was
evening
at
the
patriarch
s
ponds
the
water
in
the
pond
had
turned
black
and
a
light
boat
was
now
gliding
on
it
and
one
could
hear
the
splash
of
oars
and
the
giggles
of
some
citizeness
in
the
little
boat
the
public
appeared
on
the
benches
along
the
walks
but
again
on
the
other
three
sides
of
the
square
and
not
on
the
side
where
our
interlocutors
were
the
sky
over
moscow
seemed
to
lose
colour
and
the
full
moon
could
be
seen
quite
distinctly
high
above
not
yet
golden
but
white
it
was
much
easier
to
breathe
and
the
voices
under
the
lindens
now
sounded
softer
eveningish
how
is
it
i
didn
t
notice
that
he
d
managed
to
spin
a
whole
story
homeless
thought
in
amazement
it
s
already
evening
or
maybe
he
wasn
t
telling
it
but
i
simply
fell
asleep
and
dreamed
it
all
but
it
must
be
supposed
that
the
professor
did
tell
the
story
after
all
otherwise
it
would
have
to
be
assumed
that
berlioz
had
had
the
same
dream
because
he
said
studying
the
foreigner
s
face
attentively
your
story
is
extremely
interesting
professor
though
it
does
not
coincide
at
all
with
the
gospel
stories
good
heavens
the
professor
responded
smiling
condescendingly
you
of
all
people
should
know
that
precisely
nothing
of
what
is
written
in
the
gospels
ever
actually
took
place
and
if
we
start
referring
to
the
gospels
as
a
historical
source
he
smiled
once
more
and
berlioz
stopped
short
because
this
was
literally
the
same
thing
he
had
been
saying
to
homeless
as
they
walked
down
bronnaya
towards
the
patriarch
s
ponds
that
s
so
berlioz
replied
but
i
m
afraid
no
one
can
confirm
that
what
you
ve
just
told
us
actually
took
place
either
oh
yes
that
there
is
one
who
can
the
professor
beginning
to
speak
in
broken
language
said
with
great
assurance
and
with
unexpected
mysteriousness
he
motioned
the
two
friends
to
move
closer
they
leaned
towards
him
from
both
sides
and
he
said
but
again
without
any
accent
which
with
him
devil
knows
why
now
appeared
now
disappeared
the
thing
is
here
the
professor
looked
around
fearfully
and
spoke
in
a
whisper
that
i
was
personally
present
at
it
all
i
was
on
pontius
pilate
s
balcony
and
in
the
garden
when
he
talked
with
kaifa
and
on
the
platform
only
secretly
incognito
so
to
speak
and
therefore
i
beg
you
not
a
word
to
anyone
total
secrecy
shh
silence
fell
and
berlioz
paled
you
how
long
have
you
been
in
moscow
he
asked
in
a
quavering
voice
i
just
arrived
in
moscow
this
very
minute
the
professor
said
perplexedly
and
only
here
did
it
occur
to
the
friends
to
take
a
good
look
in
his
eyes
at
which
they
became
convinced
that
his
left
eye
the
green
one
was
totally
insane
while
the
right
one
was
empty
black
and
dead
there
s
the
whole
explanation
for
you
berlioz
thought
in
bewilderment
a
mad
german
has
turned
up
or
just
went
crazy
at
the
ponds
what
a
story
yes
indeed
that
explained
the
whole
thing
the
most
strange
breakfast
with
the
late
philosopher
kant
the
foolish
talk
about
sunflower
oil
and
annushka
the
predictions
about
his
head
being
cut
off
and
all
the
rest
the
professor
was
mad
berlioz
realized
at
once
what
had
to
be
done
leaning
back
on
the
bench
he
winked
to
homeless
behind
the
professor
s
back
meaning
don
t
contradict
him
but
the
perplexed
poet
did
not
understand
these
signals
yes
yes
yes
berlioz
said
excitedly
incidentally
it
s
all
possible
even
very
possible
pontius
pilate
and
the
balcony
and
so
forth
did
you
come
alone
or
with
your
wife
alone
alone
i
m
always
alone
the
professor
replied
bitterly
and
where
are
your
things
professor
berlioz
asked
insinuatingly
at
the
metropol
where
are
you
staying
i
nowhere
the
halfwitted
german
answered
his
green
eye
wandering
in
wild
anguish
over
the
patriarch
s
ponds
how
s
that
but
where
are
you
going
to
live
in
your
apartment
the
madman
suddenly
said
brashly
and
winked
i
i
m
very
glad
berlioz
began
muttering
but
really
you
won
t
be
comfortable
at
my
place
and
they
have
wonderful
rooms
at
the
metropol
it
s
a
firstclass
hotel
and
there
s
no
devil
either
the
sick
man
suddenly
inquired
merrily
of
ivan
nikolaevich
no
devil
don
t
contradict
him
berlioz
whispered
with
his
lips
only
dropping
behind
the
professor
s
back
and
making
faces
there
isn
t
any
devil
ivan
nikolaevich
at
a
loss
from
all
this
balderdash
cried
out
not
what
he
ought
what
a
punishment
stop
playing
the
psycho
here
the
insane
man
burst
into
such
laughter
that
a
sparrow
flew
out
of
the
linden
over
the
seated
men
s
heads
well
now
that
is
positively
interesting
the
professor
said
shaking
with
laughter
what
is
it
with
you
no
matter
what
one
asks
for
there
isn
t
any
he
suddenly
stopped
laughing
and
quite
understandably
for
a
mentally
ill
person
fell
into
the
opposite
extreme
after
laughing
became
vexed
and
cried
sternly
so
you
mean
there
just
simply
isn
t
any
calm
down
calm
down
calm
down
professor
berlioz
muttered
for
fear
of
agitating
the
sick
man
you
sit
here
for
a
little
minute
with
comrade
homeless
and
i
ll
just
run
to
the
comer
to
make
a
phone
call
and
then
we
ll
take
you
wherever
you
like
you
don
t
know
the
city
berlioz
s
plan
must
be
acknowledged
as
correct
he
had
to
run
to
the
nearest
public
telephone
and
inform
the
foreigners
bureau
thus
and
so
there
s
some
consultant
from
abroad
sitting
at
the
patriarch
s
ponds
in
an
obviously
abnormal
state
so
it
was
necessary
to
take
measures
lest
some
unpleasant
nonsense
result
to
make
a
call
well
then
make
your
call
the
sick
man
agreed
sadly
and
suddenly
begged
passionately
but
i
implore
you
before
you
go
at
least
believe
that
the
devil
exists
i
no
longer
ask
you
for
anything
more
mind
you
there
exists
a
seventh
proof
of
it
the
surest
of
all
and
it
is
going
to
be
presented
to
you
right
now
very
good
very
good
berlioz
said
with
false
tenderness
and
winking
to
the
upset
poet
who
did
not
relish
at
all
the
idea
of
guarding
the
mad
german
set
out
for
the
exit
from
the
ponds
at
the
comer
of
bronnaya
and
yermolaevsky
lane
and
the
professor
seemed
to
recover
his
health
and
brighten
up
at
once
mikhail
alexandrovich
he
shouted
after
berlioz
the
latter
gave
a
start
looked
back
but
reassured
himself
with
the
thought
that
the
professor
had
also
learned
his
name
and
patronymic
from
some
newspaper
then
the
professor
called
out
cupping
his
hands
like
a
megaphone
would
you
like
me
to
have
a
telegram
sent
at
once
to
your
uncle
in
kiev
and
again
berlioz
winced
how
does
the
madman
know
about
the
existence
of
a
kievan
uncle
that
has
certainly
never
been
mentioned
in
any
newspapers
ohoh
maybe
homeless
is
right
after
all
and
suppose
his
papers
are
phoney
ah
what
a
strange
specimen
call
call
call
at
once
they
ll
quickly
explain
him
and
no
longer
listening
to
anything
berlioz
ran
on
here
just
at
the
exit
to
bronnaya
there
rose
from
a
bench
to
meet
the
editor
exactly
the
same
citizen
who
in
the
sunlight
earlier
had
formed
himself
out
of
the
thick
swelter
only
now
he
was
no
longer
made
of
air
but
ordinary
fleshly
and
berlioz
clearly
distinguished
in
the
beginning
twilight
that
he
had
a
little
moustache
like
chicken
feathers
tiny
eyes
ironic
and
half
drunk
and
checkered
trousers
pulled
up
so
high
that
his
dirty
white
socks
showed
mikhail
alexandrovich
drew
back
but
reassured
himself
by
reflecting
that
it
was
a
stupid
coincidence
and
that
generally
there
was
no
time
to
think
about
it
now
looking
for
the
turnstile
citizen
the
checkered
type
inquired
in
a
cracked
tenor
this
way
please
straight
on
and
you
ll
get
where
you
re
going
how
about
a
little
pint
pot
for
my
information
to
set
up
an
exchoirmaster
mugging
the
specimen
swept
his
jockey
s
cap
fromhis
head
berlioz
not
stopping
to
listen
to
the
cadging
and
clowning
choirmaster
ran
up
to
the
turnstile
and
took
hold
of
it
with
his
hand
he
turned
it
and
was
just
about
to
step
across
the
rails
when
red
and
white
light
splashed
in
his
face
a
sign
lit
up
in
a
glass
box
caution
tramcar
and
right
then
this
tramcar
came
racing
along
turning
down
the
newly
laid
line
from
yermolaevsky
to
bronnaya
having
turned
and
coming
to
the
straight
stretch
it
suddenly
lit
up
inside
with
electricity
whined
and
put
on
speed
the
prudent
berlioz
though
he
was
standing
in
a
safe
place
decided
to
retreat
behind
the
stile
moved
his
hand
on
the
crossbar
and
stepped
back
and
right
then
his
hand
slipped
and
slid
one
foot
unimpeded
as
if
on
ice
went
down
the
cobbled
slope
leading
to
the
rails
the
other
was
thrust
into
the
air
and
berlioz
was
thrown
on
to
the
rails
trying
to
get
hold
of
something
berlioz
fell
backwards
the
back
of
his
head
lightly
striking
the
cobbles
and
had
time
to
see
high
up
but
whether
to
right
or
left
he
no
longer
knew
the
goldtinged
moon
he
managed
to
turn
on
his
side
at
the
same
moment
drawing
his
legs
to
his
stomach
in
a
frenzied
movement
and
while
turning
to
make
out
the
face
completely
white
with
horror
and
the
crimson
armband
of
the
woman
driverbearing
down
on
him
with
irresistible
force
berlioz
did
not
cry
out
but
around
him
the
whole
street
screamed
with
desperate
female
voices
the
woman
driver
tore
at
the
electric
brake
the
car
dug
its
nose
into
the
ground
then
instantly
jumped
up
and
glass
flew
from
the
windows
with
a
crash
and
a
jingle
here
someone
in
berlioz
s
brain
cried
desperately
can
it
be
once
more
and
for
the
last
time
the
moon
flashed
but
now
breaking
to
pieces
and
then
it
became
dark
the
tramcar
went
over
berlioz
and
a
round
dark
object
was
thrown
up
the
cobbled
slope
below
the
fence
of
the
patriarch
s
walk
having
rolled
back
down
this
slope
it
went
bouncing
along
the
cobblestones
of
the
street
it
was
the
severed
head
of
berlioz
chapter
the
chase
the
hysterical
women
s
cries
died
down
the
police
whistles
stopped
drilling
two
ambulances
drove
off
one
with
the
headless
body
and
severed
head
to
the
morgue
the
other
with
the
beautiful
driver
wounded
by
broken
glass
street
sweepers
in
white
aprons
removed
the
broken
glass
and
poured
sand
on
the
pools
of
blood
but
ivan
nikolaevich
just
stayed
on
the
bench
as
he
had
dropped
on
to
it
before
reaching
the
turnstile
he
tried
several
times
to
get
up
but
his
legs
would
not
obey
him
something
akin
to
paralysis
had
occurred
with
homeless
the
poet
had
rushed
to
the
turnstile
as
soon
as
he
heard
the
first
scream
and
had
seen
the
head
go
bouncing
along
the
pavement
with
that
he
so
lost
his
senses
that
having
dropped
on
to
the
bench
he
bit
his
hand
until
it
bled
of
course
he
forgot
about
the
mad
german
and
tried
to
figure
out
one
thing
only
how
it
could
be
that
he
had
just
been
talking
with
berlioz
and
a
moment
later
the
head
agitated
people
went
running
down
the
walk
past
the
poet
exclaiming
something
but
ivan
nikolaevich
was
insensible
to
their
words
however
two
women
unexpectedly
ran
into
each
other
near
him
and
one
of
them
sharpnosed
and
bareheaded
shouted
the
following
to
the
other
right
next
to
the
poet
s
ear
annushka
our
annushka
from
sadovaya
it
s
her
work
she
bought
sunflower
oil
at
the
grocery
and
went
and
broke
the
whole
litrebottle
on
the
turnstile
messed
her
skirt
all
up
and
swore
and
swore
and
he
poor
man
must
have
slipped
and
right
on
to
the
rails
of
all
that
the
woman
shouted
one
word
lodged
itself
in
ivan
nikolaevich
s
upset
brain
annushka
annushka
annushka
the
poet
muttered
looking
around
anxiously
wait
a
minute
wait
a
minute
the
word
annushka
got
strung
together
with
the
words
sunflower
oil
and
then
for
some
reason
with
pontius
pilate
the
poet
dismissed
pilate
and
began
linking
up
the
chain
that
started
from
the
word
annushka
and
this
chain
got
very
quickly
linked
up
and
led
at
once
to
the
mad
professor
excuse
me
but
he
did
say
the
meeting
wouldn
t
take
place
because
annushka
had
spilled
the
oil
and
if
you
please
it
won
t
take
place
what
s
more
he
said
straight
out
that
berlioz
s
head
would
be
cut
off
by
a
woman
yes
yes
yes
and
the
driver
was
a
woman
what
is
all
this
eh
there
was
not
a
grain
of
doubt
left
that
the
mysterious
consultant
had
known
beforehand
the
exact
picture
of
the
terrible
death
of
berlioz
here
two
thoughts
pierced
the
poet
s
brain
the
first
he
s
not
mad
in
the
least
that
s
all
nonsense
and
the
second
then
didn
t
he
set
it
all
up
himself
but
in
what
manner
may
we
ask
ah
no
this
we
re
going
to
find
out
making
a
great
effort
ivan
nikolaevich
got
up
from
the
bench
and
rushed
back
to
where
he
had
been
talking
with
the
professor
and
fortunately
it
turned
out
that
the
man
had
not
left
yet
the
street
lights
were
already
lit
on
bronnaya
and
over
the
ponds
the
golden
moon
shone
and
in
the
everdeceptive
light
of
the
moon
it
seemed
to
ivan
nikolaevich
that
he
stood
holding
a
sword
not
a
walking
stick
under
his
arm
the
exchoirmaster
was
sitting
in
the
very
place
where
ivan
nikolaevich
had
sat
just
recently
now
the
busybody
had
perched
on
his
nose
an
obviously
unnecessary
pincenez
in
which
one
lens
was
missing
altogether
and
the
other
was
cracked
this
made
the
checkered
citizen
even
more
repulsive
than
he
had
been
when
he
showed
berlioz
the
way
to
the
rails
with
a
chill
in
his
heart
ivan
approached
the
professor
and
glancing
into
his
face
became
convinced
that
there
were
not
and
never
had
been
any
signs
of
madness
in
that
face
confess
who
are
you
ivan
asked
in
a
hollow
voice
the
foreigner
scowled
looked
at
the
poet
as
if
he
were
seeing
him
for
the
first
time
and
answered
inimically
no
understand
no
speak
russian
the
gent
don
t
understand
the
choirmaster
mixed
in
from
the
bench
though
no
one
had
asked
him
to
explain
the
foreigner
s
words
don
t
pretend
ivan
said
threateningly
and
felt
cold
in
the
pit
of
his
stomach
you
spoke
excellent
russian
just
now
you
re
not
a
german
and
you
re
not
a
professor
you
re
a
murderer
and
a
spy
your
papers
ivan
cried
fiercely
the
mysterious
professor
squeamishly
twisted
his
mouth
which
was
twisted
to
begin
with
then
shrugged
his
shoulders
citizen
the
loathsome
choirmaster
butted
in
again
what
re
you
doing
bothering
a
foreign
tourist
for
that
you
ll
incur
severe
punishment
and
the
suspicious
professor
made
an
arrogant
face
turned
and
walked
away
from
ivan
ivan
felt
himself
at
a
loss
breathless
he
addressed
the
choirmaster
hey
citizen
help
me
to
detain
the
criminal
it
s
your
duty
the
choirmaster
became
extraordinarily
animated
jumped
up
and
hollered
what
criminal
where
is
he
a
foreign
criminal
the
choirmaster
s
eyes
sparkled
gleefully
that
one
if
he
s
a
criminal
the
first
thing
to
do
is
shout
help
or
else
he
ll
get
away
come
on
together
now
one
two
and
here
the
choirmaster
opened
his
maw
totally
at
a
loss
ivan
obeyed
the
trickster
and
shouted
help
but
the
choirmaster
bluffed
him
and
did
not
shout
anything
ivan
s
solitary
hoarse
cry
did
not
produce
any
good
results
two
girls
shied
away
from
him
and
he
heard
the
word
drunk
ah
so
you
re
in
with
him
ivan
cried
out
waxing
wroth
what
are
you
doing
jeering
at
me
out
of
my
way
ivan
dashed
to
the
right
and
so
did
the
choirmaster
ivan
dashed
to
the
left
and
the
scoundrel
did
the
same
getting
under
my
feet
on
purpose
ivan
cried
turning
ferocious
i
ll
hand
you
over
to
the
police
ivan
attempted
to
grab
the
blackguard
by
the
sleeve
but
missed
and
caught
precisely
nothing
it
was
as
if
the
choirmaster
fell
through
the
earth
ivan
gasped
looked
into
the
distance
and
saw
the
hateful
stranger
he
was
already
at
the
exit
to
patriarch
s
lane
moreover
he
was
not
alone
the
more
than
dubious
choirmaster
had
managed
to
join
him
but
that
was
still
not
all
the
third
in
this
company
proved
to
be
a
tomcat
who
appeared
out
of
nowhere
huge
as
a
hog
black
as
soot
or
as
a
rook
and
with
a
desperate
cavalryman
s
whiskers
the
trio
set
off
down
patriarch
s
lane
the
cat
walking
on
his
hind
legs
ivan
sped
after
the
villains
and
became
convinced
at
once
that
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
catch
up
with
them
the
trio
shot
down
the
lane
in
an
instant
and
came
out
on
spiridonovka
no
matter
how
ivan
quickened
his
pace
the
distance
between
him
and
his
quarry
never
diminished
and
before
the
poet
knew
it
he
emerged
after
the
quiet
of
spiridonovka
by
the
nikitsky
gate
where
his
situation
worsened
the
place
was
swarming
with
people
besides
the
gang
of
villains
decided
to
apply
the
favourite
trick
of
bandits
here
a
scattered
getaway
the
choirmaster
with
great
dexterity
bored
his
way
on
to
a
bus
speeding
towards
the
arbat
square
and
slipped
away
having
lost
one
of
his
quarry
ivan
focused
his
attention
on
the
cat
and
saw
this
strange
cat
go
up
to
the
footboard
of
an
a
tram
waiting
at
a
stop
brazenly
elbow
aside
a
woman
who
screamed
grab
hold
of
the
handrail
and
even
make
an
attempt
to
shove
a
tenkopeck
piece
into
the
conductress
s
hand
through
the
window
open
on
account
of
the
stuffiness
ivan
was
so
struck
by
the
cat
s
behaviour
that
he
froze
motionless
by
the
grocery
store
on
the
comer
and
here
he
was
struck
for
a
second
time
but
much
more
strongly
by
the
conductress
s
behaviour
as
soon
as
she
saw
the
cat
getting
into
the
tramcar
she
shouted
with
a
malice
that
even
made
her
shake
no
cats
allowed
nobody
with
cats
allowed
scat
get
off
or
i
ll
call
the
police
neither
the
conductress
nor
the
passengers
were
struck
by
the
essence
of
the
matter
not
just
that
a
cat
was
boarding
a
tramcar
which
would
have
been
good
enough
but
that
he
was
going
to
pay
the
cat
turned
out
to
be
not
only
a
solvent
but
also
a
disciplined
animal
at
the
very
first
shout
from
the
conductress
he
halted
his
advance
got
off
the
footboard
and
sat
down
at
the
stop
rubbing
his
whiskers
with
the
tenkopeck
piece
but
as
soon
as
the
conductress
yanked
the
cord
and
the
tramcar
started
moving
off
the
cat
acted
like
anyone
who
has
been
expelled
from
a
tramcar
but
still
needs
a
ride
letting
all
three
cars
go
by
the
cat
jumped
on
to
the
rear
couplingpin
of
the
last
one
wrapped
its
paws
around
some
hose
sticking
out
of
the
side
and
rode
off
thus
saving
himself
ten
kopecks
occupied
with
the
obnoxious
cat
ivan
almost
lost
the
main
one
of
the
three
the
professor
but
fortunately
the
man
had
not
managed
to
slip
away
ivan
saw
the
grey
beret
in
the
throng
at
the
head
of
bolshaya
nikitskaya
now
herzen
street
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
ivan
arrived
there
himself
however
he
had
no
luck
the
poet
would
quicken
his
pace
break
into
a
trot
shove
passersby
yet
not
get
an
inch
closer
to
the
professor
upset
as
he
was
ivan
was
still
struck
by
the
supernatural
speed
of
the
chase
twenty
seconds
had
not
gone
by
when
after
the
nikitsky
gate
ivan
nikolaevich
was
already
dazzled
by
the
lights
of
the
arbat
square
another
few
seconds
and
here
was
some
dark
lane
with
slanting
sidewalks
where
ivan
nikolaevich
took
a
tumble
and
hurt
his
knee
again
a
litup
thoroughfare
kropotkin
street
then
a
lane
then
ostozhenka
then
another
lane
dismal
vile
and
sparsely
lit
and
it
was
here
that
ivan
nikolaevich
definitively
lost
him
whom
he
needed
so
much
the
professor
disappeared
ivan
nikolaevich
was
perplexed
but
not
for
long
because
he
suddenly
realized
that
the
professor
must
unfailingly
be
found
in
house
no
and
most
assuredly
in
apartment
bursting
into
the
entrance
ivan
nikolaevich
flew
up
to
the
second
floor
immediately
found
the
apartment
and
rang
impatiently
he
did
not
have
to
wait
long
some
little
girl
of
about
five
opened
the
door
for
ivan
and
without
asking
him
anything
immediately
went
away
somewhere
in
the
huge
extremely
neglected
front
hall
weakly
lit
by
a
tiny
carbon
arc
lamp
under
the
high
ceiling
black
with
grime
a
bicycle
without
tyres
hung
on
the
wall
a
huge
ironbound
trunk
stood
and
on
a
shelf
over
the
coat
rack
a
winter
hat
lay
its
long
earflaps
hanging
down
behind
one
of
the
doors
a
resonant
male
voice
was
angrily
shouting
something
in
verse
from
a
radio
set
ivan
nikolaevich
was
not
the
least
at
a
loss
in
the
unfamiliar
surroundings
and
rushed
straight
into
the
corridor
reasoning
thus
of
course
he
s
hiding
in
the
bathroom
the
corridor
was
dark
having
bumped
into
the
wall
a
few
times
ivan
saw
a
faint
streak
of
light
under
a
door
felt
for
the
handle
and
pulled
it
gently
the
hook
popped
out
and
ivan
found
himself
precisely
in
the
bathroom
and
thought
how
lucky
he
was
however
his
luck
was
not
all
it
might
have
been
ivan
met
with
a
wave
of
humid
heat
and
by
the
light
of
the
coals
smouldering
in
the
boiler
made
out
big
basins
hanging
on
the
walls
and
a
bath
tub
all
black
frightful
blotches
where
the
enamel
had
chipped
off
and
there
in
this
bath
tub
stood
a
naked
citizeness
all
soapy
and
with
a
scrubber
in
her
hand
she
squinted
nearsightedly
at
the
burstingin
ivan
and
obviously
mistaking
him
in
the
infernal
light
said
softly
and
gaily
kiriushka
stop
this
tomfoolery
have
you
lost
your
mind
fyodor
ivanych
will
be
back
any
minute
get
out
right
now
and
she
waved
at
ivan
with
the
scrubber
the
misunderstanding
was
evident
and
ivan
nikolaevich
was
of
course
to
blame
for
it
but
he
did
not
want
to
admit
it
and
exclaiming
reproachfully
ah
wanton
creature
at
once
found
himself
for
some
reason
in
the
kitchen
no
one
was
there
and
on
the
oven
in
the
semidarkness
silently
stood
about
a
dozen
extinguished
primuses
a
single
moonbeam
having
seeped
through
the
dusty
perennially
unwashed
window
shone
sparsely
into
the
comer
where
in
dust
and
cobwebs
a
forgotten
icon
hung
with
the
ends
of
two
wedding
candles
peeking
out
from
behind
its
casing
under
the
big
icon
pinned
to
it
hung
a
little
one
made
of
paper
no
one
knows
what
thought
took
hold
of
ivan
here
but
before
running
out
the
back
door
he
appropriated
one
of
these
candles
as
well
as
the
paper
icon
with
these
objects
he
left
the
unknown
apartment
muttering
something
embarrassed
at
the
thought
of
what
he
had
just
experienced
in
the
bathroom
involuntarily
trying
to
guess
who
this
impudent
kiriushka
might
be
and
whether
the
disgusting
hat
with
earflaps
belonged
to
him
in
the
desolate
joyless
lane
the
poet
looked
around
searching
for
the
fugitive
but
he
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
then
ivan
said
firmly
to
himself
why
of
course
he
s
at
the
moscow
river
onward
someone
ought
perhaps
to
have
asked
ivan
nikolaevich
why
he
supposed
that
the
professor
was
precisely
at
the
moscow
river
and
not
in
some
other
place
but
the
trouble
was
that
there
was
no
one
to
ask
him
the
loathsome
lane
was
completely
empty
in
the
very
shortest
time
ivan
nikolaevich
could
be
seen
on
the
granite
steps
of
the
moscow
river
amphitheatre
having
taken
off
his
clothes
ivan
entrusted
them
to
a
pleasant
bearded
fellow
who
was
smoking
a
handrolled
cigarette
sitting
beside
a
torn
white
tolstoy
blouse
and
a
pair
of
unlaced
worn
boots
after
waving
his
arms
to
cool
off
ivan
dived
swallowfashion
into
the
water
it
took
his
breath
away
so
cold
the
water
was
and
the
thought
even
flashed
in
him
that
he
might
not
manage
to
come
up
to
the
surface
however
he
did
manage
to
come
up
and
puffing
and
snorting
his
eyes
rounded
in
terror
ivan
nikolaevich
began
swimming
through
the
black
oilsmelling
water
among
the
broken
zigzags
of
street
lights
on
the
bank
when
the
wet
ivan
came
dancing
back
up
the
steps
to
the
place
where
the
bearded
fellow
was
guarding
his
clothes
it
became
clear
that
not
only
the
latter
but
also
the
former
that
is
the
bearded
fellow
himself
had
been
stolen
in
the
exact
spot
where
the
pile
of
clothes
had
been
a
pair
of
striped
drawers
the
torn
tolstoy
blouse
the
candle
the
icon
and
a
box
of
matches
had
been
left
after
threatening
someone
in
the
distance
with
his
fist
in
powerless
angerivan
put
on
what
was
left
for
him
here
two
considerations
began
to
trouble
him
first
that
his
massolit
identification
card
which
he
never
parted
with
was
gone
and
second
whether
he
could
manage
to
get
through
moscow
unhindered
looking
the
way
he
did
now
in
striped
drawers
after
all
true
it
was
nobody
s
business
but
still
there
might
be
some
hitch
or
delay
ivan
tore
off
the
buttons
where
the
drawers
fastened
at
the
ankle
figuring
that
this
way
they
might
pass
for
summer
trousers
gathered
up
the
icon
the
candle
and
the
matches
and
started
off
saying
to
himself
to
griboedov
s
beyond
all
doubt
he
s
there
the
city
was
already
living
its
evening
life
trucks
flew
through
the
dust
chains
clanking
and
on
their
platforms
men
lay
sprawled
belly
up
on
sacks
all
windows
were
open
in
each
of
these
windows
a
light
burned
under
an
orange
lampshade
and
from
every
window
every
door
every
gateway
roof
and
attic
basement
and
courtyard
blared
the
hoarse
roar
of
the
polonaise
from
the
operaevgeny
onegin
ivan
nikolaevich
s
apprehensions
proved
fully
justified
passersby
did
pay
attention
to
him
and
turned
their
heads
as
a
result
he
took
the
decision
to
leave
the
main
streets
and
make
his
way
through
back
lanes
where
people
are
not
so
importunate
where
there
were
fewer
chances
of
them
picking
on
a
barefoot
man
pestering
him
with
questions
about
his
drawers
which
stubbornly
refused
to
look
like
trousers
this
ivan
did
and
penetrating
the
mysterious
network
of
lanes
around
the
arbat
he
began
making
his
way
along
the
walls
casting
fearful
sidelong
glances
turning
around
every
moment
hiding
in
gateways
from
time
to
time
avoiding
intersections
with
traffic
lights
and
the
grand
entrances
of
embassy
mansions
and
all
along
his
difficult
way
he
was
for
some
reason
inexpressibly
tormented
by
the
ubiquitous
orchestra
that
accompanied
the
heavy
basso
singing
about
his
love
for
tatiana
chapter
there
were
doings
at
griboedov
s
the
old
twostoreyed
creamcoloured
house
stood
on
the
ring
boulevard
in
the
depths
of
a
seedy
garden
separated
from
the
sidewalk
by
a
fancy
castiron
fence
the
small
terrace
in
front
of
the
house
was
paved
with
asphalt
and
in
wintertime
was
dominated
by
a
snow
pile
with
a
shovel
stuck
in
it
but
in
summertime
turned
into
the
most
magnificent
section
of
the
summer
restaurant
under
a
canvas
tent
the
house
was
called
the
house
of
griboedov
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
alleged
to
have
once
belonged
to
an
aunt
of
the
writer
alexander
sergeevich
griboedov
now
whether
it
did
or
did
not
belong
to
her
we
do
not
exactly
know
on
recollection
it
even
seems
that
griboedov
never
had
any
such
houseowning
aunt
nevertheless
that
was
what
the
house
was
called
moreover
one
moscow
liar
had
it
that
there
on
the
second
floor
in
a
round
hall
with
columns
the
famous
writer
had
supposedly
read
passages
fromwoe
from
wit
to
this
very
aunt
while
she
reclined
on
a
sofa
however
devil
knows
maybe
he
did
it
s
of
no
importance
what
is
important
is
that
at
the
present
time
this
house
was
owned
by
that
same
massolit
which
had
been
headed
by
the
unfortunate
mikhail
alexandrovich
berlioz
before
his
appearance
at
the
patriarch
s
ponds
in
the
casual
manner
of
massolit
members
no
one
called
the
house
the
house
of
griboedov
everyone
simply
said
griboedov
s
i
spent
two
hours
yesterday
knocking
about
griboedov
s
well
and
so
got
myself
a
month
in
yalta
bravo
or
go
to
berlioz
he
receives
today

so
on

settled
itself
at
griboedov
s
in
the
best
and
cosiest
way
imaginable
anyone
entering
griboedov
s
first
of
all
became
involuntarily
acquainted
with
the
announcements
of
various
sports

with

well
as
individual
photographs
of
the
members
of

hanging
the
photographs
on
the
walls
of
the
staircase
leading
to
the
second
floor
on
the
door
to
the
very
first
room
of
this
upper
floor
one
could
see
a
big
sign

with
the
picture
of

the
next
door
bore
a
brief
but
now
totally
incomprehensible
inscription
perelygino
after
which
the
chance
visitor
to
griboedov
s
would
not
know
where
to
look
from
the
motley

if
one
cut
through

already
went
downstairs

out
to
the

one
could
see
the

on
a
door
which
people
were
crashing
every
second
beyond
the

opened
out
a

was

not

some

next
obedient
to
the
whimsical

of

came
the

various

and
finally
that

where
the

delighted
in
the
comedy
of
her
genius
nephew
any
visitor
finding
himself

unless
of

he
was
a
total
dimwit
would
realize
at
once
what
a
good
life
those
lucky
fellows
the
massolit
members
were
having
and
black
envy
would
immediately
start
gnawing
at
him
and
he
would
immediately
address
bitter
reproaches
to
heaven
for
not
having
endowed
him
at
birth
with
literary
talent
lacking
which
there
was
naturally
no
dreaming
of
owning
a
massolit
membership
card
brown
smelling
of
costly
leather
with
a
wide
gold
border
a
card
known
to
all
moscow
who
will
speak
in
defence
of
envy
this
feeling
belongs
to
the
nasty
category
but
all
the
same
one
must
put
oneself
in
the
visitor
s
position
for
what
he
had
seen
on
the
upper
floor
was
not
all
and
was
far
from
all
the
entire
ground
floor
of
the
aunt
s
house
was
occupied
by
a
restaurant
and
what
a
restaurant
it
was
justly
considered
the
best
in
moscow
and
not
only
because
it
took
up
two
vast
halls
with
arched
ceilings
painted
with
violet
assyrianmaned
horses
not
only
because
on
each
table
there
stood
a
lamp
shaded
with
a
shawl
not
only
because
it
was
not
accessible
to
just
anybody
coming
in
off
the
street
but
because
in
the
quality
of
its
fare
griboedov
s
beat
any
restaurant
in
moscow
up
and
down
and
this
fare
was
available
at
the
most
reasonable
by
no
means
onerous
price
hence
there
was
nothing
surprising
for
instance
in
the
following
conversation
which
the
author
of
these
most
truthful
lines
once
heard
near
the
castiron
fence
of
griboedov

where

a

protested
just

you
mean
to
say
foka
that
perch
can
be
met
with
at
the
coliseum
as
well
but
at
the
coliseum
a
portion
of
perch
costs
thirteen
roubles
fifteen
kopecks
and
here

besides

they

reader
follow
me
at
half
past
ten
on
the
evening
when
berlioz
died
at
the
patriarch
s
ponds
only
one
room
was
lit
upstairs
at
griboedov
s
and
in
it
languished
twelve
writers
who
had
gathered
for
a
meeting
and
were
waiting
for
mikhail
alexandrovich
sitting
on
chairs
and
on
tables
and
even
on
the
two
windowsills
in
the
office
of
the
massolit
executive
board
they
suffered
seriously
from
the
heat
not
a
single
breath
of
fresh
air
came
through
the
open
windows
moscow
was
releasing
the
heat
accumulated
in
the
asphalt
all
day
and
it
was
clear
that
night
would
bring
no
relief
the
smell
of
onions
came
from
the
basement
of
the
aunt
s
house
where
the
restaurant
kitchen
was
at
work
they
were
all
thirsty
they
were
all
nervous
and
angry
the
belletrist
beskudnikov
a
quiet
decently
dressed
man
with
attentive
and
at
the
same
time
elusive
eyes
took
out
his
watch
the
hand
was
crawling
towards
eleven
beskudnikov
tapped
his
finger
on
the
face
and
showed
it
to
the
poet
dvubratsky
who
was
sitting
next
to
him
on
the
table
and
in
boredom
dangling
his
feet
shod
in
yellow
shoes
with
rubber
treads
anyhow
grumbled
dvubratsky
the
laddie
must
ve
got
stuck
on
the
klyazma
came
the
thickvoiced
response
of
nastasya
lukinishna
nepremenova
orphan
of
a
moscow
merchant
who
had
become
a
writer
and
wrote
stories
about
sea
battles

penname
of

george
excuse
me
boldly
exclaimed
zagrivov
an
author
of
popular
sketches
but
i
personally
would
prefer
a
spot
of
tea
on
the
balcony
to
stewing

but
there

spied
amidst

the
novelist
ieronym
poprikhin
said
venomously
and
bitterly
some
are
lucky
and
some
aren

the
critic
ababkov
droned
from
the
windowsill
bos
n
george
s
little
eyes
lit
up
with
glee
and
she
said
softening
her
contralto
we

of

that
got

dachas
the
generals
glukharev
the
scenarist
cut
right
into

glukharev
said
behind
him
lavrovich

deniskin
cried
out
and
the
dining
room
s
panelled
in
oak
eh
that
s
not
the
point
right
now
ababkov
droned
it
s
that
it
s
half
past
eleven
a
clamour
arose
something
like
rebellion
was
brewing
they
started
telephoning
hated
perelygino
got
the
wrong
dacha
lavrovich
s
found
out
that
lavrovich
had
gone
to
the
river
which
made
them
totally
upset
they
called
at
random
to
the
commission
on
fine
literature
extension
and
of
course
found
no
one
there
he
might
have
called
shouted
deniskin
glukharev
and
quant
ah
they
were
shouting
in
vain
mikhail
alexandrovich
could
not
call
anywhere
far
far
from
griboedov
s
in
an
enormous
room
lit
by
thousandwatt
bulbs
on
three
zinc
tables
lay
what
had
still
recently
been
mikhail
alexandrovich
on
the
first
lay
the
naked
body
covered
with
dried
blood
one
arm
broken
the
chest
caved
in
on
the
second
the
head
with
the
front
teeth
knocked
out
with
dull
open
eyes
unafraid
of
the
brightest
light
and
on
the
third
a
pile
of
stiffened
rags
near
the
beheaded
body
stood
a
professor
of
forensic
medicine
a
pathological
anatomist
and
his
dissector
representatives
of
the
investigation
and
mikhail
alexandrovich
s
assistant
in
massolit
the
writer
zheldybin
summoned
by
telephone
from
his
sick
wife
s
side
a
car
had
come
for
zheldybin
and
first
of
all
taken
him
together
with
the
investigators
this
was
around
midnight
to
the
dead
man
s
apartment
where
the
sealing
of
his
papers
had
been
carried
out
after
which
they
all
went
to
the
morgue
and
now
those
standing
by
the
remains
of
the
deceased
were
debating
what
was
the
better
thing
to
do
to
sew
the
severed
head
to
the
neck
or
to
lay
out
the
body
in
the
hall
at
griboedov
s
after
simply
covering
the
dead
man
snugly
to
the
chin
with
a
black
cloth
no
mikhail
alexandrovich
could
not
call
anywhere
and
deniskin
glukharev
and
quant
along
with
beskudnikov
were
being
indignant
and
shouting
quite
in
vain
exactly
at
midnight
all
twelve
writers
left
the
upper
floor
and
descended
to
the
restaurant
here
again
they
silently
berated
mikhail
alexandrovich
all
the
tables
on
the
veranda
naturally
were
occupied
and
they
had
to
stay
for
supper
in
those
beautiful
but
airless
halls
and
exactly
at
midnight
in
the
first
of
these
halls
something
crashed
jangled
spilled
leaped
and
all
at
once
a
high
male
voice
desperately
cried

out
the

of

which
the

sent
down
a
sloping
chute
to
the
kitchen
in
short
hell
and
at
midnight
there
came
an
apparition
in
hell
a
handsome
darkeyed
man
with
a
daggerlike
beard
in
a
tailcoat
stepped
on
to
the
veranda
and
cast
a
regal
glance
over
his
domain
they
used
to
say
the
mystics
used
to
say
that
there
was
a
time
when
the
handsome
man
wore
not
a
tailcoat
but
a
wide
leather
belt
with
pistol
butts
sticking
from
it
and
his
raven
hair
was
tied
with
scarlet
silk
and
under
his
command
a
brig
sailed
the
caribbean
under
a
black
death
flag
with
a
skull
and
crossbones
but
no
no
the
seductive
mystics
are
lying
there
are
no
caribbean
seas
in
the
world
no
desperate
freebooters
sail
them
no
corvette
chases
after
them
no
cannon
smoke
drifts
across
the
waves
there
is
nothing
and
there
was
nothing
there
is
that
sickly
linden
over
there
there
is
the
castiron
fence
and
the
boulevard
beyond
it
and
the
ice
is
melting
in
the
bowl
and
at
the
next
table
you
see
someone
s
bloodshot
bovine
eyes
and
you
re
afraid
afraid
oh
gods
my
gods
poison
bring
me
poison
and
suddenly
a
word
fluttered
up
from
some
table
berlioz
the
jazz
broke
up
and
fell
silent
as
if
someone
had
hit
it
with
a
fist
what
what
what
what
berlioz
and
they
began
jumping
up
exclaiming
yes
a
wave
of
grief
billowed
up
at
the
terrible
news
about
mikhail
alexandrovich
someone
fussed
about
crying
that
it
was
necessary
at
once
straight
away
without
leaving
the
spot
to
compose
some
collective
telegram
and
send
it
off
immediately
but
what
telegram
may
we
ask
and
where
and
why
send
it
and
where
indeed
and
what
possible
need
for
any
telegram
does
someone
have
whose
flattened
pate
is
now
clutched
in
the
dissector
s
rubber
hands
whose
neck
the
professor
is
now
piercing
with
curved
needles
he
s
dead
and
has
no
need
of
any
telegrams
it
s
all
over
let
s
not
burden
the
telegraph
wires
any
more
yes
he
s
dead
dead
but
as
for
us
we
re
alive
yes
a
wave
of
grief
billowed
up
held
out
for
a
while
but
then
began
to
subside
and
somebody
went
back
to
his
table
and
sneakily
at
first
then
openly
drank
a
little
vodka
and
ate
a
bite
and
really
can
one
let
chicken
cutlets
de
volaille
perish
how
can
we
help
mikhail
alexandrovich
by
going
hungry
but
after
all
we
re
alive
naturally
the
grand
piano
was
locked
the
jazz
band
dispersed
several
journalists
left
for
their
offices
to
write
obituaries
it
became
known
that
zheldybin
had
come
from
the
morgue
he
had
installed
himself
in
the
deceased
s
office
upstairs
and
the
rumour
spread
at
once
that
it
was
he
who
would
replace
berlioz
zheldybin
summoned
from
the
restaurant
all
twelve
members
of
the
board
and
at
the
urgently
convened
meeting
in
berlioz
s
office
they
started
a
discussion
of
the
pressing
questions
of
decorating
the
hallwith
columns
at
griboedov
s
of
transporting
the
body
from
the
morgue
to
that
hall
of
opening
it
to
the
public
and
all
else
connected
with
the
sad
event
and
the
restaurant
began
to
live
its
usual
nocturnal
life
and
would
have
gone
on
living
it
until
closing
time
that
is
until
four
o
clock
in
the
morning
had
it
not
been
for
an
occurrence
which
was
completely
out
of
the
ordinary
and
which
struck
the
restaurant
s
clientele
much
more
than
the
news
of
berlioz
s
death
the
first
to
take
alarm
were
the
coachmen
waiting
at
the
gates
of
the
griboedov
house
one
of
them
rising
on
his
box
was
heard
to
cry
out
hooee
just
look
at
that
after
which
from
god
knows
where
a
little
light
flashed
by
the
castiron
fence
and
began
to
approach
the
veranda
those
sitting
at
the
tables
began
to
get
up
and
peer
at
it
and
saw
that
along
with
the
little
light
a
white
ghost
was
marching
towards
the
restaurant
when
it
came
right
up
to
the
trellis
everybody
sat
as
if
frozen
at
their
tables
chunks
of
sterlet
on
their
forks
eyes
popping
the
doorman
who
at
that
moment
had
stepped
out
of
the
restaurant
coat
room
to
have
a
smoke
in
the
yard
stamped
out
his
cigarette
and
made
for
the
ghost
with
the
obvious
intention
of
barring
its
way
into
the
restaurant
but
for
some
reason
did
not
do
so
and
stopped
smiling
stupidly
and
the
ghost
passing
through
an
opening
in
the
trellis
stepped
unhindered
on
to
the
veranda
here
everyone
saw
that
it
was
no
ghost
at
all
but
ivan
nikolaevich
homeless
the
muchrenowned
poet
he
was
barefoot
in
a
torn
whitish
tolstoy
blouse
with
a
paper
icon
bearing
the
image
of
an
unknown
saint
pinned
to
the
breast
of
it
with
a
safety
pin
and
was
wearing
striped
white
drawers
in
his
hand
ivan
nikolaevich
carried
a
lighted
wedding
candle
ivan
nikolaevich
s
right
cheek
was
freshly
scratched
it
would
even
be
difficult
to
plumb
the
depths
of
the
silence
that
reigned
on
the
veranda
beer
could
be
seen
running
down
on
to
the
floor
from
a
mug
tilted
in
one
waiter
s
hand
the
poet
raised
the
candle
over
his
head
and
said
loudly
hail
friends
after
which
he
peeked
under
the
nearest
table
and
exclaimed
ruefully
no
he
s
not
there
two
voices
were
heard
a
basso
said
pitilessly
that
s
it
delirium
tremens
and
the
second
a
woman
s
frightened
uttered
the
words
how
could
the
police
let
him
walk
the
streets
like
that
this
ivan
nikolaevich
heard
and
replied
they
tried
to
detain
me
twice
in
skaterny
and
here
on
bronnaya
but
i
hopped
over
the
fence
and
as
you
can
see
cut
my
cheek
here
ivan
nikolaevich
raised
the
candle
and
cried
out
brethren
in
literature
his
hoarse
voice
grew
stronger
and
more
fervent
listen
to
me
everyone
he
has
appeared

him
immediately
otherwise

ll
do
untold
harm

voices
came
from
all
sides
the
consultant
ivan
replied
and
this
consultant
just
killed
misha
berlioz
at
the
patriarch
s
ponds
here
people
came
flocking
to
the
veranda
from
the
inner
rooms
a
crowd
gathered
around
ivan
s
flame
excuse
me
excuse
me
be
more
precise
a
soft
and
polite
voice
said
over
ivan
nikolaevich
s

a
foreign
consultant
a
professor
and
a

ivan
said
looking
around
and
what
is
his
name
came
softly
to
ivan
s
ear
that
s
just
it
his
name
ivan
cried
in
anguish
if
only
i
knew
his
name
i
didn
t
make

name
on
his
visiting
card
i
only

asked
himself
clutching
his
forehead
andsuddenly
started
muttering
wi

the
hair
on

began
to
crawl
with
the
tension
wolf
some
woman
cried
pitifully
ivan
became
angry
fool
he
cried
seeking
the
woman
with
his
eyes
what

to
do
with
it
wolf

not

what

let
them
send
out
five
motor
cycles
with
machineguns
to
catch
the
professor
and
don
t
forget
to
tell
them
that
there
are
two
others
with
him
a
long
checkered
one
cracked

and
a
cat
black
and
fat
and
meanwhile
i

s
i
sense
that
he
s

ivan
became
anxious
pushed
away
the
people
around
him
started
waving
the
candle
pouring
wax
on
himself
and
looking
under
the
tables
here
someone
said
call
a
doctor
and
someone
s
benign
fleshy
face
clean
shaven
and
well
nourished
in
hornrimmed
glasses
appeared
before
ivan
comrade
homeless
the
face
began
in
a
guest
speaker
s
voice
calm
down
you

upset
at
the
death
of

beloved

alexandrovich
no

well
you
need
rest

comrades

take
you
home
to
bed
right
now

ll
forget

ivan
interrupted
baring
his
teeth
but
don
t
you
understand
that
the
professor
has
to
be
caught
and
you
come
at
me
with
your
foolishness
cretin
pardon
me
comrade
homeless
the
face
replied
blushing
retreating
and
already
repentant
at
having
got
mixed
up
in
this
affair
no
anyone
else
but
you
i
will
not
pardon
ivan
nikolaevich
said
with
quiet
hatred
a
spasm
distorted
his
face
he
quickly
shifted
the
candle
from
his
right
hand
to
his
left
swung
roundly
and
hit
the
compassionate
face
on
the
ear
here
it
occurred
to
them
to
fall
upon
ivan
and
so
they
did
the
candle
went
out
and
the
glasses
that
had
fallen
from
the
face
were
instantly
trampled
ivan
let
out
a
terrible
war
cry
heard
to
the
temptation
of
all
even
on
the
boulevard
and
set
about
defending
himself
dishes
fell
clattering
from
the
tables
women
screamed
all
the
while
the
waiters
were
tying
up
the
poet
with
napkins
a
conversation
was
going
on
in
the
coat
room
between
the
commander
of
the
brig
and
the
doorman
didn
t
you
see
he
was
in
his
underpants
the
pirate
inquired
coldly
but
archibald
archibaldovich
the
doorman
replied
cowering
how
could
i
not
let
him
in
if
he
s
a
member
of
massolit
didn
t
you
see
he
was
in
his
underpants
the
pirate
repeated
pardon
me
archibald
archibaldovich
the
doorman
said
turning
purple
but
what
could
i
do
i
understand
there
are
ladies
sitting
on
the
veranda
ladies
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
it
makes
no
difference
to
the
ladies
the
pirate
replied
literally
burning
the
doorman
up
with
his
eyes
but
it
does
to
the
police
a
man
in
his
underwear
can
walk
the
streets
of
moscow
only
in
this
one
case
that
he
s
accompanied
by
the
police
and
only
to
one
place
the
police
station
and
you
if
you
re
a
doorman
ought
to
know
that
on
seeing
such
a
man
you
must
without
a
moment
s
delay
start
blowing
your
whistle
do
you
hear
do
you
hear
what
s
going
on
on
the
veranda
here
the
halfcrazed
doorman
heard
some
sort
of
hooting
coming
from
the
veranda
the
smashing
of
dishes
and
women
s
screams
now
what
s
to
be
done
with
you
for
that
the
freebooter
asked
the
skin
on
the
doorman
s
face
acquired
a
typhoid
tinge
his
eyes
went
dead
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
black
hair
now
combed
and
parted
was
covered
with
flaming
silk
the
shirtfront
and
tailcoat
disappeared
and
a
pistol
butt
emerged
tucked
into
a
leather
belt
the
doorman
pictured
himself
hanging
from
the
foretopsail
yard
his
eyes
saw
his
own
tongue
sticking
out
and
his
lifeless
head
lolling
on
his
shoulder
and
even
heard
the
splash
of
waves
against
the
hull
the
doorman
s
knees
gave
way
but
here
the
freebooter
took
pity
on
him
and
extinguished
his
sharp
gaze
watch
out
nikolai
this
is
the
last
time
we
have
no
need
of
such
doormen
in
the
restaurant
go
find
yourself
a
job
as
a
beadle
having
said
this
the
commander
commanded
precisely
clearly
rapidly
get
pantelei
from
the
snack
bar
police
protocol
a
car
to
the
psychiatric
clinic
and
added
blow
your
whistle
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
an
extremely
astounded
public
not
only
in
the
restaurant
but
on
the
boulevard
itself
and
in
the
windows
of
houses
looking
on
to
the
restaurant
garden
saw
pantelei
the
doorman
a
policeman
a
waiter
and
the
poet
riukhin
carry
through
the
gates
of
griboedov
s
a
young
man
swaddled
like
a
doll
dissolved
in
tears
who
spat
aiming
precisely
at
riukhin
and
shouted
for
all
the
boulevard
to
hear
you
bastard
you
bastard
a
truckdriver
with
a
spiteful
face
was
starting
his
motor
next
to
him
a
coachman
rousing
his
horse
slapping
it
on
the
croup
with
violet
reins
shouted
have
a
run
for
your
money
i
ve
taken
em
to
the
psychics
before
around
them
the
crowd
buzzed
discussing
the
unprecedented
event
in
short
there
was
a
nasty
vile
tempting
swinish
scandal
which
ended
only
when
the
truck
carried
away
from
the
gates
of
griboedov
s
the
unfortunate
ivan
nikolaevich
the
policeman
pantelei
and
riukhin
chapter
schizophrenia
as
was
said
it
was
half
past
one
in
the
morning
when
a
man
with
a
pointed
beard
and
wearing
a
white
coat
came
out
to
the
examining
room
of
the
famous
psychiatric
clinic
built
recently
on
the
outskirts
of
moscow
by
the
bank
of
the
river
three
orderlies
had
their
eyes
fastened
on
ivan
nikolaevich
who
was
sitting
on
a
couch
the
extremely
agitated
poet
riukhin
was
also
there
the
napkins
with
which
ivan
nikolaevich
had
been
tied
up
lay
in
a
pile
on
the
same
couch
ivan
nikolaevich
s
arms
and
legs
were
free
seeing
the
entering
man
riukhin
turned
pale
coughed
and
said
timidly
hello
doctor
the
doctor
bowed
to
riukhin
but
as
he
bowed
looked
not
at
him
but
at
ivan
nikolaevich
the
latter
sat
perfectly
motionless
with
an
angry
face
and
knitted
brows
and
did
not
even
stir
at
the
doctor
s
entrance
here
doctor
riukhin
began
speaking
for
some
reason
in
a
mysterious
whisper
glancing
timorously
at
ivan
nikolaevich
is
the
renowned
poet
ivan
homeless
well
you
see
we
re
afraid
it
might
be
delirium
tremens
was
he
drinking
hard
the
doctor
said
through
his
teeth
no
he
drank
but
not
really
so
did
he
chase
after
cockroaches
rats
little
devils
or
slinking
dogs
no
riukhin
replied
with
a
shudder
i
saw
him
yesterday
and
this
morning
he
was
perfectly
well
and
why
is
he
in
his
drawers
did
you
get
him
out
of
bed
no
doctor
he
came
to
the
restaurant
that
way
aha
aha
the
doctor
said
with
great
satisfaction
and
why
the
scratches
did
he
have
a
fight
he
fell
off
a
fence
and
then
in
the
restaurant
he
hit
somebody
and
then
somebody
else
so
so
so
the
doctor
said
and
turning
to
ivan
added
hello
there
greetings
saboteur
ivan
replied
spitefully
and
loudly
riukhin
was
so
embarrassed
that
he
did
not
dare
raise
his
eyes
to
the
courteous
doctor
but
the
latter
not
offended
in
the
least
took
off
his
glasses
with
a
habitual
deft
movement
raised
the
skirt
of
his
coat
put
them
into
the
back
pocket
of
his
trousers
and
then
asked
ivan
how
old
are
you
you
can
all
go
to
the
devil
ivan
shouted
rudely
and
turned
away
but
why
are
you
angry
did
i
say
anything
unpleasant
to
you
i
m
twentythree
years
old
ivan
began
excitedly
and
i
ll
file
a
complaint
against
you
all
and
particularly
against
you
louse
he
adverted
separately
to
riukhin
and
what
do
you
want
to
complain
about
about
the
fact
that
i
a
healthy
man
was
seized
and
dragged
by
force
to
a
madhouse
ivan
replied
wrathfully
here
riukhin
looked
closely
at
ivan
and
went
cold
there
was
decidedly
no
insanity
in
the
man
s
eyes
no
longer
dull
as
they
had
been
at
griboedov
s
they
were
now
clear
as
ever
good
god
riukhin
thought
fearfully
so
he
s
really
normal
what
nonsense
why
in
fact
did
we
drag
him
here
he
s
normal
normal
only
his
mug
got
scratched
you
are
the
doctor
began
calmly
sitting
down
on
a
white
stool
with
a
shiny
foot
not
in
a
madhouse
but
in
a
clinic
where
no
one
will
keep
you
if
it
s
not
necessary
ivan
nikolaevich
glanced
at
him
mistrustfully
out
of
the
comer
of
his
eye
but
still
grumbled
thank
the
lord
one
normal
man
has
finally
turned
up
among
the
idiots
of
whom
the
first
is
that
giftless
goof
sashka
who
is
this
giftless
sashka
the
doctor
inquired
this
one
here
riukhin
ivan
replied
jabbing
his
dirty
finger
in
riukhin
s
direction
the
latter
flushed
with
indignation
that
s
the
thanks
i
get
he
thought
bitterly
for
showing
concern
for
him
what
trash
really
psychologically
a
typical
little
kulak
ivan
nikolaevich
began
evidently
from
an
irresistible
urge
to
denounce
riukhin
and
what
s
more
a
little
kulak
carefully
disguising
himself
as
a
proletarian
look
at
his
lenten
physiognomy
and
compare
it
with
those
resounding
verses
he
wrote
for
the
first
of
may
heh
heh
heh
soaring
up
and
soaring
down
but
if
you
could
look
inside
him
and
see
what
he
thinks
you
d
gasp
and
ivan
nikolaevich
burst
into
sinister
laughter
riukhin
was
breathing
heavily
turned
red
and
thought
of
just
one
thing
that
he
had
warmed
a
serpent
on
his
breast
that
he
had
shown
concern
for
a
man
who
turned
out
to
be
a
vicious
enemy
and
above
all
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
there
s
no
arguing
with
the
mentally
ill
and
why
actually
were
you
brought
here
the
doctor
asked
after
listening
attentively
to
homeless
s
denunciations
devil
take
them
the
numskulls
they
seized
me
tied
me
up
with
some
rags
and
dragged
me
away
in
a
truck
may
i
ask
why
you
came
to
the
restaurant
in
just
your
underwear
there
s
nothing
surprising
about
that
ivan
replied
i
went
for
a
swim
in
the
moscow
river
so
they
filched
my
clothes
and
left
me
this
trash
i
couldn
t
very
well
walk
around
moscow
naked
i
put
it
on
because
i
was
hurrying
to
griboedov
s
restaurant
the
doctor
glanced
questioningly
at
riukhin
who
muttered
glumly
the
name
of
the
restaurant
aha
said
the
doctor
and
why
were
you
in
such
a
hurry
some
business
meeting
i
m
trying
to
catch
the
consultant
ivan
nikolaevich
said
and
looked
around
anxiously
what
consultant
do
you
know
berlioz
ivan
asked
significantly
the
composer
ivan
got
upset
what
composer
ah
yes
ah
no
the
composer
has
the
same
name
as
misha
berlioz
riukhin
had
no
wish
to
say
anything
but
was
forced
to
explain
the
secretary
of
massolit
berlioz
was
run
over
by
a
tramcar
tonight
at
the
patriarch
s
ponds
don
t
blab
about
what
you
don
t
know
ivan
got
angry
with
riukhin
i
was
there
not
you
he
got
him
under
the
tramcar
on
purpose
pushed
him
pushed
him
nothing
ivan
exclaimed
angered
by
the
general
obtuseness
his
kind
don
t
need
to
push
he
can
perform
such
stunts
hold
on
to
your
hat
he
knew
beforehand
that
berlioz
would
get
under
the
tramcar
and
did
anyone
besides
you
see
this
consultant
that
s
the
trouble
it
was
just
berlioz
and
i
so
and
what
measures
did
you
take
to
catch
this
murderer
here
the
doctor
turned
and
sent
a
glance
towards
a
woman
in
a
white
coat
who
was
sitting
at
a
table
to
one
side
she
took
out
a
sheet
of
paper
and
began
filling
in
the
blank
spaces
in
its
columns
here
s
what
measures
i
took
a
little
candle
from
the
kitchen
that
one
asked
the
doctor
pointing
to
the
broken
candle
lying
on
the
table
in
front
of
the
woman
next
to
the
icon
that
very
one
and
and
why
the
icon
ah
yes
the
icon
ivan
blushed
it
was
the
icon
that
frightened
them
most
of
all
he
again
jabbed
his
finger
in
the
direction
of
riukhin
but
the
thing
is
that
he
the
consultant
he
let
s
speak
directly
is
mixed
up
with
the
unclean
powers
and
you
won
t
catch
him
so
easily
the
orderlies
for
some
reason
snapped
to
attention
and
fastened
their
eyes
on
ivan
yes
sirs
ivan
went
on
mixed
up
with
them
an
absolute
fact
he
spoke
personally
with
pontius
pilate
and
there
s
no
need
to
stare
at
me
like
that
i
m
telling
the
truth
he
saw
everything
the
balcony
and
the
palm
trees
in
short
he
was
at
pontius
pilate
s
i
can
vouch
for
it
come
come
well
so
i
pinned
the
icon
on
my
chest
and
ran
here
the
clock
suddenly
struck
twice
ohoh
ivan
exclaimed
and
got
up
from
the
couch
it
s
two
o
clock
and
i
m
wasting
time
with
you
excuse
me
where
s
the
telephone
let
him
use
the
telephone
the
doctor
told
the
orderlies
ivan
grabbed
the
receiver
and
the
woman
meanwhile
quietly
asked
riukhin
is
he
married
single
riukhin
answered
fearfully
member
of
a
trade
union
yes
police
ivan
shouted
into
the
receiver
police
comrade
officeronduty
give
orders
at
once
for
five
motor
cycles
with
machineguns
to
be
sent
out
to
catch
the
foreign
consultant
what
come
and
pick
me
up
i
ll
go
with
you
it
s
the
poet
homeless
speaking
from
the
madhouse
what
s
your
address
homeless
asked
the
doctor
in
a
whisper
covering
the
receiver
with
his
hand
and
then
again
shouting
into
it
are
you
listening
hello
outrageous
ivan
suddenly
screamed
and
hurled
the
receiver
against
the
wall
then
he
turned
to
the
doctor
offered
him
his
hand
said
goodbye
drily
and
made
as
if
to
leave
for
pity
s
sake
where
do
you
intend
to
go
the
doctor
said
peering
into
ivan
s
eyes
in
the
dead
of
night
in
your
underwear
you
re
not
feeling
well
stay
with
us
let
me
pass
ivan
said
to
the
orderlies
who
closed
ranks
at
the
door
will
you
let
me
pass
or
not
the
poet
shouted
in
a
terrible
voice
riukhin
trembled
but
the
woman
pushed
a
button
on
the
table
and
a
shiny
little
box
with
a
sealed
ampoule
popped
out
on
to
its
glass
surface
ah
so
ivan
said
turning
around
with
a
wild
and
hunted
look
well
then
goodbye
and
he
rushed
head
first
into
the
windowblind
the
crash
was
rather
forceful
but
the
glass
behind
the
blind
gave
no
crack
and
in
an
instant
ivan
nikolaevich
was
struggling
in
the
hands
of
the
orderlies
he
gasped
tried
to
bite
shouted
so
that
s
the
sort
of
windows
you
ve
got
here
let
me
go
let
me
go
a
syringe
flashed
in
the
doctor
s
hand
with
a
single
movement
the
woman
slit
the
threadbare
sleeve
of
the
shirt
and
seized
the
arm
with
unwomanly
strength
there
was
a
smell
of
ether
ivan
went
limp
in
the
hands
of
the
four
people
the
deft
doctor
took
advantage
of
this
moment
and
stuck
the
needle
into
ivan
s
arm
they
heldivan
for
another
few
seconds
and
then
lowered
him
on
to
the
couch
bandits
ivan
shouted
and
jumped
up
from
the
couch
but
was
installed
on
it
again
the
moment
they
let
go
of
him
he
again
jumped
up
but
sat
back
down
by
himself
he
paused
gazing
around
wildly
then
unexpectedly
yawned
then
smiled
maliciously
locked
me
up
after
all
he
said
yawned
again
unexpectedly
lay
down
put
his
head
on
the
pillow
his
fist
under
his
head
like
a
child
and
muttered
now
in
a
sleepy
voice
without
malice
very
well
then
you
ll
pay
for
it
yourselves
i
ve
warned
you
you
can
do
as
you
like
i
m
now
interested
most
of
all
in
pontius
pilate
pilate
and
he
closed
his
eyes
a
bath
a
private
room
number
and
a
nurse
to
watch
him
the
doctor
ordered
as
he
put
his
glasses
on
here
riukhin
again
gave
a
start
the
white
door
opened
noiselessly
behind
it
a
corridor
could
be
seen
lit
by
blue
nightlights
out
of
the
corridor
rolled
a
stretcher
on
rubber
wheelsto
which
the
quieted
ivan
was
transferred
and
then
he
rolled
off
down
the
corridor
and
the
door
closed
behind
him
doctor
the
shaken
riukhin
asked
in
a
whisper
it
means
he
s
really
ill
oh
yes
replied
the
doctor
but
what
s
wrong
with
him
then
riukhin
asked
timidly
the
tired
doctor
glanced
at
riukhin
and
answered
listlessly
locomotor
and
speech
excitation
delirious
interpretations
a
complex
case
it
seems
schizophrenia
i
suppose
plus
this
alcoholism
riukhin
understood
nothing
from
the
doctor
s
words
except
that
things
were
evidently
not
so
great
with
ivan
nikolaevich
he
sighed
and
asked
but
what
s
all
this
talk
of
his
about
some
consultant
he
must
have
seen
somebody
who
struck
his
disturbed
imagination
or
maybe
a
hallucination
a
few
minutes
later
the
truck
was
carrying
riukhin
off
to
moscow
day
was
breaking
and
the
light
of
the
street
lights
still
burning
along
the
highway
was
now
unnecessary
and
unpleasant
the
driver
was
vexed
at
having
wasted
the
night
drove
the
truck
as
fast
as
he
could
and
skidded
on
the
turns
now
the
woods
dropped
off
stayed
somewhere
behind
and
the
river
went
somewhere
to
the
side
and
an
omnium
gatherum
came
spilling
to
meet
the
truck
fences
with
sentry
boxes
and
stacks
of
wood
tall
posts
and
some
sort
of
poles
with
spools
strung
on
the
poles
heaps
of
rubble
the
earth
scored
by
canals
in
short
you
sensed
that
she
was
there
moscow
right
there
around
the
turn
and
about
to
heave
herself
upon
you
and
engulf
you
riukhin
was
jolted
and
tossed
about
the
sort
of
stump
he
had
placed
himself
on
kept
trying
to
slide
out
from
under
him
the
restaurant
napkins
thrown
in
by
the
policeman
and
pantelei
who
had
left
earlier
by
bus
moved
all
around
the
flatbed
riukhin
tried
to
collect
them
but
then
for
some
reason
hissing
spitefully
devil
take
them
what
am
i
doing
fussing
like
a
fool
he
spurned
them
aside
with
his
foot
and
stopped
looking
at
them
the
rider
s
state
of
mind
was
terrible
it
was
becoming
clear
that
his
visit
to
the
house
of
sorrow
had
left
the
deepest
mark
on
him
riukhin
tried
to
understand
what
was
tormenting
him
the
corridor
with
blue
lights
which
had
stuck
itself
to
his
memory
the
thought
that
there
is
no
greater
misfortune
inthe
world
than
the
loss
of
reason
yes
yes
of
course
that
too
but
that
that
s
only
a
general
thought
there
s
something
else
what
is
it
an
insult
that
s
what
yes
yes
insulting
words
hurled
right
in
his
face
by
homeless
and
the
trouble
is
not
that
they
were
insulting
but
that
there
was
truth
in
them
the
poet
no
longer
looked
around
but
staring
into
the
dirty
shaking
floor
began
muttering
something
whining
gnawing
at
himself
yes
poetry
he
was
thirtytwo
years
old
and
indeed
what
then
so
then
he
would
go
on
writing
his
several
poems
a
year
into
old
age
yes
into
old
age
what
would
these
poems
bring
him
glory
what
nonsense
don
t
deceive
yourself
at
least
glory
will
never
come
to
someone
who
writes
bad
poems
what
makes
them
bad
the
truth
he
was
telling
the
truth
riukhin
addressed
himself
mercilessly
i
don
t
believe
in
anything
i
write
poisoned
by
this
burst
of
neurasthenia
the
poet
swayed
the
floor
under
him
stopped
shaking
riukhin
raised
his
head
and
saw
that
he
had
long
been
in
moscow
and
what
s
more
that
it
was
dawn
over
moscow
that
the
cloud
was
underlit
with
gold
that
his
truck
had
stopped
caught
in
a
column
of
other
vehicles
at
the
turn
on
to
the
boulevard
and
that
very
close
to
him
on
a
pedestal
stood
a
metal
man
his
head
inclined
slightly
gazing
at
the
boulevard
with
indifference
some
strange
thoughts
flooded
the
head
of
the
ailing
poet
there
s
an
example
of
real
luck
here
riukhin
rose
to
his
full
height
on
the
flatbed
of
the
truck
and
raised
his
arm
for
some
reason
attacking
the
castiron
man
who
was
not
bothering
anyone
whatever
step
he
made
in
his
life
whatever
happened
to
him
it
all
turned
to
his
benefit
itall
led
to
his
glory
but
what
did
he
do
i
can
t
conceive
is
there
anything
special
in
the
words
the
snowstorm
covers
i
don
t
understand
luck
sheer
luck
riukhin
concluded
with
venom
and
felt
the
truck
moving
under
him
he
shot
him
that
white
guard
shot
him
smashed
his
hip
and
assured
his
immortality
the
column
began
to
move
in
no
more
than
two
minutes
the
completely
ill
and
even
aged
poet
was
entering
the
veranda
of
griboedov
s
it
was
now
empty
in
a
comer
some
company
was
finishing
its
drinks
and
in
the
middle
the
familiar
master
of
ceremonies
was
bustling
about
wearing
a
skullcap
with
a
glass
of
abrau
wine
in
his
hand
riukhin
laden
with
napkins
was
met
affably
by
archibald
archibaldovich
and
at
once
relieved
of
the
cursed
rags
had
riukhin
not
become
so
worn
out
in
the
clinic
and
on
the
truck
he
would
certainly
have
derived
pleasure
from
telling
how
everything
had
gone
in
the
hospital
and
embellishing
the
story
with
invented
details
but
just
then
he
was
far
from
such
things
and
little
observant
though
riukhin
was
now
after
the
torture
on
the
truck
he
peered
keenly
at
the
pirate
for
the
first
time
and
realized
that
though
the
man
asked
about
homeless
and
even
exclaimed
aiyaiyai
he
was
essentially
quite
indifferent
to
homeless
s
fate
and
did
not
feel
a
bit
sorry
for
him
and
bravo
right
you
are
riukhin
thought
with
cynical
selfannihilating
malice
and
breaking
off
the
story
about
the
schizophrenia
begged
archibald
archibaldovich
a
drop
of
vodka
the
pirate
made
a
compassionate
face
and
whispered
i
understand
this
very
minute
and
beckoned
to
a
waiter
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
riukhin
sat
in
complete
solitude
hunched
over
his
bream
drinking
glass
after
glass
understanding
and
recognizing
that
it
was
no
longer
possible
to
set
anything
right
in
his
life
that
it
was
only
possible
to
forget
the
poet
had
wasted
his
night
while
others
were
feasting
and
now
understood
that
it
was
impossible
to
get
it
back
one
needed
only
to
raise
one
s
head
from
the
lamp
to
the
sky
to
understand
that
the
night
was
irretrievably
lost
waiters
were
hurriedly
tearing
the
tablecloths
from
the
tables
the
cats
slinking
around
the
veranda
had
a
morning
look
day
irresistibly
heaved
itself
upon
the
poet
chapter
a
naughty
apartment
if
styopa
likhodeev
had
been
told
the
next
morning
styopa
you
ll
be
shot
if
you
don
t
get
up
this
minute
styopa
would
have
replied
in
a
languid
barely
audible
voice
shoot
me
do
what
you
like
with
me
i
won
t
get
up
not
only
not
get
up
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
could
not
open
his
eyes
because
if
he
were
to
do
so
there
would
be
a
flash
of
lightning
and
his
head
would
at
once
be
blown
to
pieces
a
heavy
bell
was
booming
in
that
head
brown
spots
rimmed
with
fiery
green
floated
between
his
eyeballs
and
his
closed
eyelids
and
to
crown
it
all
he
was
nauseous
this
nausea
as
it
seemed
to
him
being
connected
with
the
sounds
of
some
importunate
gramophone
styopa
tried
to
recall
something
but
only
one
thing
would
get
recalled
that
yesterday
apparently
and
in
some
unknown
place
he
had
stood
with
a
napkin
in
his
hand
and
tried
to
kiss
some
lady
promising
her
that
the
next
day
and
exactly
at
noon
he
would
come
to
visit
her
the
lady
had
declined
saying
no
no
i
won
t
be
home
but
styopa
had
stubbornlyinsisted
and
i
ll
just
up
and
come
anyway
who
the
lady
was
and
what
time
it
was
now
what
day
of
what
month
styopa
decidedly
did
not
know
and
worst
of
all
he
could
not
figure
out
where
he
was
he
attempted
to
learn
this
last
at
least
and
to
that
end
unstuck
the
stucktogether
lids
of
his
left
eye
something
gleamed
dully
in
the
semidarkness
styopa
finally
recognized
the
pierglass
and
realized
that
he
was
lying
on
his
back
in
his
own
bed
that
is
the
jeweller
s
wife
s
former
bed
in
the
bedroom
here
he
felt
such
a
throbbing
in
his
head
that
he
closed
his
eyes
and
moaned
let
us
explain
styopa
likhodeev
director
of
the
variety
theatre
had
come
to
his
senses
that
morning
at
home
in
the
very
apartment
which
he
shared
with
the
late
berlioz
in
a
big
sixstoreyed
ushaped
building
on
sadovaya
street
it
must
be
said
that
this
apartment
no
had
long
had
if
not
a
bad
at
least
a
strange
reputation
two
years
ago
it
had
still
belonged
to
the
widow
of
the
jeweller
de
fougeray
anna
frantsevna
de
fougeray
a
respectable
and
very
practical
fiftyyearold
woman
let
out
three
of
the
five
rooms
to
lodgers
one
whose
last
name
was
apparently
belomut
and
another
with
a
lost
last
name
and
then
two
years
ago
inexplicable
events
began
to
occur
in
this
apartment
people
began
to
disappear
from
this
apartment
without
a
trace
once
on
a
day
off
a
policeman
came
to
the
apartment
called
the
second
lodger
the
one
whose
last
name
got
lost
out
to
the
front
hall
and
said
he
was
invited
to
come
to
the
police
station
for
a
minute
to
put
his
signature
to
something
the
lodger
told
anfisa
anna
frantsevna
s
longtime
and
devoted
housekeeper
to
say
in
case
he
received
any
telephone
calls
that
he
would
be
back
in
ten
minutes
and
left
together
with
the
proper
whitegloved
policeman
he
not
only
did
not
come
back
in
ten
minutes
but
never
came
back
at
all
the
most
surprising
thing
was
that
the
policeman
evidently
vanished
along
with
him
the
pious
or
to
speak
more
frankly
superstitious
anfisa
declared
outright
to
the
very
upset
anna
frantsevna
that
it
was
sorcery
and
that
she
knew
perfectly
well
who
had
stolen
both
the
lodger
and
the
policeman
only
she
did
not
wish
to
talk
about
it
towards
nighttime
well
but
with
sorcery
as
everyone
knows
once
it
starts
there
s
no
stopping
it
the
second
lodger
is
remembered
to
have
disappeared
on
a
monday
and
that
wednesday
belomut
seemed
to
drop
from
sight
though
true
under
different
circumstances
in
the
morning
a
car
came
as
usual
to
take
him
to
work
and
it
did
take
him
to
work
but
it
did
not
bring
anyoneback
or
come
again
itself
madame
belomut
s
grief
and
horror
defied
description
but
alas
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
continued
for
long
that
same
night
on
returning
with
anfisa
from
her
dacha
which
anna
frantsevna
had
hurried
off
to
for
some
reason
she
did
not
find
the
wife
of
citizen
belomut
in
the
apartment
and
not
only
that
the
doors
of
the
two
rooms
occupied
by
the
belomut
couple
turned
out
to
be
sealed
two
days
passed
somehow
on
the
third
day
anna
frantsevna
who
had
suffered
all
the
while
from
insomnia
again
left
hurriedly
for
her
dacha
needless
to
say
she
never
came
back
left
alone
anfisa
having
wept
her
fill
went
to
sleep
past
one
o
clock
in
the
morning
what
happened
to
her
after
that
is
not
known
but
lodgers
in
other
apartments
told
of
hearing
some
sort
of
knocking
all
night
in
no
and
of
seeing
electric
light
burning
in
the
windows
till
morning
in
the
morning
it
turned
out
that
there
was
also
no
anfisa
for
a
long
time
all
sorts
of
legends
were
repeated
in
the
house
about
these
disappearances
and
about
the
accursed
apartment
such
as
for
instance
that
this
dry
and
pious
little
anfisa
had
supposedly
carried
on
her
driedup
breast
in
a
suede
bag
twentyfive
big
diamonds
belonging
to
anna
frantsevna
that
in
the
woodshed
of
that
very
dacha
to
which
anna
frantsevna
had
gone
so
hurriedly
there
supposedly
turned
up
of
themselves
some
inestimable
treasures
in
the
form
of
those
same
diamonds
plus
some
gold
coins
of
tsarist
minting
and
so
on
in
the
same
vein
well
what
we
don
t
know
we
can
t
vouch
for
however
it
may
have
been
the
apartment
stood
empty
and
sealed
for
only
a
week
then
the
late
berlioz
moved
in
with
his
wife
and
this
same
styopa
also
with
his
wife
it
was
perfectly
natural
that
as
soon
as
they
got
into
the
malignant
apartment
devil
knows
what
started
happening
with
them
as
well
namely
within
the
space
of
a
month
both
wives
vanished
but
these
two
not
without
a
trace
of
berlioz
s
wife
it
was
told
that
she
had
supposedly
been
seen
in
kharkov
with
some
balletmaster
while
styopa
s
wife
allegedly
turned
up
on
bozhedomka
street
where
wagging
tongues
said
the
director
of
the
variety
using
his
innumerable
acquaintances
had
contrived
to
get
her
a
room
but
on
the
one
condition
that
she
never
show
her
face
on
sadovaya
and
so
styopa
moaned
he
wanted
to
call
the
housekeeper
grunya
and
ask
her
for
aspirin
but
was
still
able
to
realize
that
it
was
foolish
and
that
grunya
of
course
had
no
aspirin
he
tried
to
call
berlioz
for
help
groaned
twice
misha
misha
but
as
you
will
understand
received
no
reply
the
apartment
was
perfectly
silent
moving
his
toes
styopa
realized
that
he
was
lying
there
in
his
socks
passed
his
trembling
hand
down
his
hip
to
determine
whether
he
had
his
trousers
on
or
not
but
failed
finally
seeing
that
he
was
abandoned
and
alone
and
there
was
no
one
to
help
him
he
decided
to
get
up
however
inhuman
the
effort
it
cost
him
styopa
unstuck
his
glued
eyelids
and
saw
himself
reflected
in
the
pierglass
as
a
man
with
hair
sticking
out
in
all
directions
with
a
bloated
physiognomy
covered
with
black
stubble
with
puffy
eyes
a
dirty
shirt
collar
and
necktie
in
drawers
and
socks
so
he
saw
himself
in
the
pierglass
and
next
to
the
mirror
he
saw
an
unknown
man
dressed
in
black
and
wearing
a
black
beret
styopa
sat
up
in
bed
and
goggled
his
bloodshot
eyes
as
well
as
he
could
at
the
unknown
man
the
silence
was
broken
by
this
unknown
man
who
said
in
a
low
heavy
voice
and
with
a
foreign
accent
the
following
words
good
morning
my
most
sympathetic
stepan
bogdanovich
there
was
a
pause
after
which
making
a
most
terrible
strain
on
himself
styopa
uttered
what
can
i
do
for
you
and
was
amazed
not
recognizing
his
own
voice
he
spoke
the
word
what
in
a
treble
can
i
in
a
bass
and
his
do
for
you
did
not
come
off
at
all
the
stranger
smiled
amicably
took
out
a
big
gold
watch
with
a
diamond
triangle
on
the
lid
rang
eleven
times
and
said
eleven
and
for
exactly
an
hour
i
ve
been
waiting
for
you
to
wake
up
since
you
made
an
appointment
for
me
to
come
to
your
place
at
ten
here
i
am
styopa
felt
for
his
trousers
on
the
chair
beside
his
bed
whispered
excuse
me
put
them
on
and
asked
hoarsely
tell
me
your
name
please
he
had
difficulty
speaking
at
each
word
someone
stuck
a
needle
into
his
brain
causing
infernal
pain
what
you
ve
forgotten
my
name
too
here
the
unknown
man
smiled
forgive
me
styopa
croaked
feeling
that
his
hangover
had
presented
him
with
a
new
symptom
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
floor
beside
his
bed
went
away
and
that
at
any
moment
he
would
go
flying
down
to
the
devil
s
dam
in
the
nether
world
my
dear
stepan
bogdanovich
the
visitor
said
with
a
perspicacious
smile
no
aspirin
will
help
you
follow
the
wise
old
rule
cure
like
with
like
the
only
thing
that
will
bring
you
back
to
life
is
two
glasses
of
vodka
with
something
pickled
and
hot
to
go
with
it
styopa
was
a
shrewd
man
and
sick
as
he
was
realized
that
since
he
had
been
found
in
this
state
he
would
have
to
confess
everything
frankly
speaking
he
began
his
tongue
barely
moving
yesterday
i
got
a
bit
not
a
word
more
the
visitor
answered
and
drew
aside
with
his
chair
styopa
rolling
his
eyes
saw
that
a
tray
had
been
set
on
a
small
table
on
which
tray
there
were
sliced
white
bread
pressed
caviar
in
a
little
bowl
pickled
mushrooms
on
a
dish
something
in
a
saucepan
and
finally
vodka
in
a
roomy
decanter
belonging
to
the
jeweller
s
wife
what
struck
styopa
especially
was
that
the
decanter
was
frosty
with
cold
this
however
was
understandable
it
was
sitting
in
a
bowl
packed
with
ice
in
short
the
service
was
neat
efficient
the
stranger
did
not
allow
styopa
s
amazement
to
develop
to
a
morbid
degree
but
deftly
poured
him
half
a
glass
of
vodka
and
you
styopa
squeaked
with
pleasure
his
hand
twitching
styopa
brought
the
glass
to
his
lips
while
the
stranger
swallowed
the
contents
of
his
glass
at
one
gulp
chewing
a
lump
of
caviar
styopa
squeezed
out
of
himself
the
words
and
you
a
bite
of
something
much
obliged
but
i
never
snack
the
stranger
replied
and
poured
seconds
the
saucepan
was
opened
and
found
to
contain
frankfurters
in
tomato
sauce
and
then
the
accursed
green
haze
before
his
eyes
dissolved
the
words
began
to
come
out
clearly
and
above
all
styopa
remembered
a
thing
or
two
namely
that
it
had
taken
place
yesterday
in
skhodnya
at
the
dacha
of
the
sketchwriter
khustov
to
which
this
same
khustov
had
taken
styopa
in
a
taxi
there
was
even
a
memory
of
having
hired
this
taxi
by
the
metropol
and
there
was
also
some
actor
or
not
an
actor
with
a
gramophone
in
a
little
suitcase
yes
yes
yes
it
was
at
the
dacha
the
dogs
he
remembered
had
howled
from
this
gramophone
only
the
lady
styopa
had
wanted
to
kiss
remained
unexplained
devil
knows
who
she
was
maybe
she
was
in
radio
maybe
not
the
previous
day
was
thus
coming
gradually
into
focus
but
right
now
styopa
was
much
more
interested
in
today
s
day
and
particularly
in
the
appearance
in
his
bedroom
of
a
stranger
and
with
hors
d
œuvres
and
vodka
to
boot
it
would
be
nice
to
explain
that
well
i
hope
by
now
you
ve
remembered
my
name
but
styopa
only
smiled
bashfully
and
spread
his
arms
really
i
get
the
feeling
that
you
followed
the
vodka
with
port
wine
good
heavens
it
simply
isn
t
done
i
beg
you
to
keep
it
between
us
styopa
said
fawningly
oh
of
course
of
course
but
as
for
khustov
needless
to
say
i
can
t
vouch
for
him
so
you
know
khustov
yesterday
in
your
office
i
saw
this
individuum
briefly
but
it
only
takes
a
fleeting
glance
at
his
face
to
understand
that
he
is
a
bastard
a
squabbler
a
trimmer
and
a
toady
perfectly
true
thought
styopa
struck
by
such
a
true
precise
and
succinct
definition
of
khustov
yes
the
previous
day
was
piecing
itself
together
but
even
so
anxiety
would
not
take
leave
of
the
director
of
the
variety
the
thing
was
that
a
huge
black
hole
yawned
in
this
previous
day
say
what
you
will
styopa
simply
had
not
seen
this
stranger
in
the
beret
in
his
office
yesterday
professor
of
black
magic
woland
the
visitor
said
weightily
seeing
styopa
s
difficulty
and
he
recounted
everything
in
order
yesterday
afternoon
he
arrived
in
moscow
from
abroad
went
immediately
to
styopa
and
offered
his
show
to
the
variety
styopa
telephoned
the
moscow
regional
entertainment
commission
and
had
the
question
approved
styopa
turned
pale
and
blinked
then
signed
a
contract
with
professor
woland
for
seven
performances
styopa
opened
his
mouth
and
arranged
that
woland
should
come
the
next
morning
at
ten
o
clock
to
work
out
the
details
and
so
woland
came
having
come
he
was
met
by
the
housekeeper
grunya
who
explained
that
she
had
just
come
herself
that
she
was
not
a
livein
maid
that
berlioz
was
not
home
and
that
if
the
visitor
wished
to
see
stepan
bogdanovich
he
should
go
to
his
bedroomhimself
stepan
bogdanovich
was
such
a
sound
sleeper
that
she
would
not
undertake
to
wake
him
up
seeing
what
condition
stepan
bogdanovich
was
in
the
artiste
sent
grunya
to
the
nearest
grocery
store
for
vodka
and
hors
d
œuvres
to
the
druggist
s
for
ice
and
allow
me
to
reimburse
you
the
mortified
styopa
squealed
and
began
hunting
for
his
wallet
oh
what
nonsense
the
guest
performer
exclaimed
and
would
hear
no
more
of
it
and
so
the
vodka
and
hors
d
œuvres
got
explained
but
all
the
same
styopa
was
a
pity
to
see
he
remembered
decidedly
nothing
about
the
contract
and
on
his
life
had
not
seen
this
woland
yesterday
yes
khustov
had
been
there
but
not
woland
may
i
have
a
look
at
the
contract
styopa
asked
quietly
please
do
please
do
styopa
looked
at
the
paper
and
froze
everything
was
in
place
first
of
all
styopa
s
own
dashing
signature
aslant
the
margin
a
note
in
the
hand
of
the
findirector
rimsky
authorizing
the
payment
of
ten
thousand
roubles
to
the
artiste
woland
as
an
advance
on
the
thirtyfive
thousand
roubles
due
him
for
seven
performances
what
s
more
woland
s
signature
was
right
there
attesting
to
his
receipt
of
the
ten
thousand
what
is
all
this
the
wretched
styopa
thought
his
head
spinning
was
he
starting
to
have
ominous
gaps
of
memory
well
it
went
without
saying
once
the
contract
had
been
produced
any
further
expressions
of
surprise
would
simply
be
indecent
styopa
asked
his
visitor
s
leave
to
absent
himself
for
a
moment
and
just
as
he
was
in
his
stocking
feet
ran
to
the
front
hall
for
the
telephone
on
his
way
he
called
out
in
the
direction
of
the
kitchen
grunya
but
no
one
responded
he
glanced
at
the
door
to
berlioz
s
study
which
was
next
to
the
front
hall
and
here
he
was
as
they
say
flabbergasted
on
the
doorhandle
he
made
out
an
enormous
wax
seal
on
a
string
hello
someone
barked
in
styopa
s
head
just
what
we
needed
and
here
styopa
s
thoughts
began
running
on
twin
tracks
but
as
always
happens
in
times
of
catastrophe
in
the
same
direction
and
generally
devil
knows
where
it
is
even
difficult
to
convey
the
porridge
in
styopa
s
head
here
was
this
devilry
with
the
black
beret
the
chilled
vodka
and
the
incredible
contract
and
along
with
all
that
if
you
please
a
seal
on
the
door
as
well
that
is
tell
anyone
you
like
that
berlioz
has
been
up
to
no
good
no
one
will
believe
it
by
jove
no
one
will
believe
it
yet
look
there
s
the
seal
yes
sir
and
here
some
most
disagreeable
little
thoughts
began
stirring
in
styopa
s
brain
about
the
article
which
as
luck
would
have
it
he
had
recently
inflicted
on
mikhail
alexandrovich
for
publication
in
his
journal
the
article
just
between
us
was
idiotic
and
worthless
and
the
money
was
so
little
immediately
after
the
recollection
of
the
article
there
came
flying
a
recollection
of
some
dubious
conversation
that
had
taken
place
he
recalled
on
the
twentyfourth
of
april
in
the
evening
right
there
in
the
dining
room
while
styopa
was
having
dinner
with
mikhail
alexandrovich
that
is
of
course
this
conversation
could
not
have
been
called
dubious
in
the
full
sense
of
the
word
styopa
would
not
have
ventured
upon
such
a
conversation
but
it
was
on
some
unnecessary
subject
he
had
been
quite
free
dear
citizens
not
to
begin
it
before
the
seal
this
conversation
would
undoubtedly
have
been
considered
a
perfect
trifle
but
now
after
the
seal
ah
berlioz
berlioz
boiled
up
in
styopa
s
head
this
is
simply
too
much
for
one
head
but
it
would
not
do
to
grieve
too
long
and
styopa
dialled
the
number
of
the
office
of
the
variety
s
findirector
rimsky
styopa
s
position
was
ticklish
first
the
foreigner
might
get
offended
that
styopa
was
checking
on
him
after
the
contract
had
been
shown
and
then
to
talk
with
the
findirector
was
also
exceedingly
difficult
indeed
he
could
not
just
ask
him
like
that
tell
me
did
isign
a
contract
for
thirtyfive
thousand
roubles
yesterday
with
a
professor
of
black
magic
it
was
no
good
asking
like
that
yes
rimsky
s
sharp
unpleasant
voice
came
from
the
receiver
hello
grigory
danilovich
styopa
began
speaking
quietly
it
s
likhodeev
there
s
a
certain
matter
hm
hm
i
have
this
er
artiste
woland
sitting
here
so
you
see
i
wanted
to
ask
how
about
this
evening
ah
the
black
magician
rimsky
s
voice
responded
in
the
receiver
the
posters
will
be
ready
shortly
uhhuh
styopa
said
in
a
weak
voice
well
bye
and
you
ll
be
coming
in
soon
rimsky
asked
in
half
an
hour
styopa
replied
and
hanging
up
the
receiver
pressed
his
hot
head
in
his
hands
ah
what
a
nasty
thing
to
have
happen
what
was
wrong
with
his
memory
citizens
eh
however
to
go
on
lingering
in
the
front
hall
was
awkward
and
styopa
formed
a
plan
straight
away
by
all
means
to
conceal
his
incredible
forgetfulness
and
now
first
off
contrive
to
get
out
of
the
foreigner
what
in
fact
he
intended
to
show
that
evening
in
the
variety
of
which
styopa
was
in
charge
here
styopa
turned
away
from
the
telephone
and
saw
distinctly
in
the
mirror
that
stood
in
the
front
hall
and
which
the
lazy
grunya
had
not
wiped
for
ages
a
certain
strange
specimen
long
as
a
pole
and
in
a
pincenez
ah
if
only
ivan
nikolaevich
had
been
there
he
would
have
recognized
this
specimen
at
once
the
figure
was
reflected
and
then
disappeared
styopa
looked
further
down
the
hall
in
alarm
and
was
rocked
a
second
time
for
in
the
mirror
a
stalwart
black
cat
passed
and
also
disappeared
styopa
s
heart
skipped
a
beat
he
staggered
what
is
all
this
he
thought
am
i
losing
my
mind
where
are
these
reflections
coming
from
he
peeked
into
the
front
hall
and
cried
timorously
grunya
what
s
this
cat
doing
hanging
around
here
where
did
he
come
from
and
the
other
one
don
t
worry
stepan
bogdanovich
a
voice
responded
not
grunya
s
but
the
visitor
s
from
the
bedroom
the
cat
is
mine
don
t
be
nervous
and
grunya
is
not
here
i
sent
her
off
to
voronezh
she
complained
you
diddled
her
out
of
a
vacation
these
words
were
so
unexpected
and
preposterous
that
styopa
decided
he
had
not
heard
right
utterly
bewildered
he
trotted
back
to
the
bedroom
and
froze
on
the
threshold
his
hair
stood
on
end
and
small
beads
of
sweat
broke
out
on
his
brow
the
visitor
was
no
longer
alone
in
the
bedroom
but
had
company
in
the
second
armchair
sat
the
same
type
he
had
imagined
in
the
front
hall
now
he
was
clearly
visible
the
feathery
moustache
one
lens
of
the
pincenez
gleaming
the
other
not
there
but
worse
things
were
to
be
found
in
the
bedroom
on
the
jeweller
s
wife
s
ottoman
in
a
casual
pose
sprawled
a
third
party
namely
a
black
cat
of
uncanny
size
with
a
glass
of
vodka
in
one
paw
and
a
fork
on
which
he
had
managed
to
spear
a
pickled
mushroom
in
the
other
the
light
faint
in
the
bedroom
anyway
now
began
to
grow
quite
dark
in
styopa
s
eyes
this
is
apparently
how
one
loses
one
s
mind
he
thought
and
caught
hold
of
the
doorpost
i
see
you
re
somewhat
surprised
my
dearest
stepan
bogdanovich
woland
inquired
of
the
teethchattering
styopa
and
yet
there
s
nothing
to
be
surprised
at
this
is
my
retinue
here
the
cat
tossed
off
the
vodka
and
styopa
s
hand
began
to
slide
down
the
doorpost
and
this
retinue
requires
room
woland
continued
so
there
s
just
one
too
many
of
us
in
the
apartment
and
it
seems
to
us
that
this
one
too
many
is
precisely
you
theirself
theirself
the
long
checkered
one
sang
in
a
goat
s
voice
referring
to
styopa
in
the
plural
generally
theirself
has
been
up
to
some
terrible
swinishness
lately
drinking
using
their
position
to
have
liaisons
with
women
don
t
do
devil
a
thing
and
can
t
do
anything
because
they
don
t
know
anything
of
what
they
re
supposed
to
do
pulling
the
wool
over
their
superiors
eyes
availing
hisself
of
a
government
car
the
cat
snitched
chewing
a
mushroom
and
here
occurred
the
fourth
and
last
appearance
in
the
apartment
as
styopa
having
slid
all
the
way
to
the
floor
clawed
at
the
doorpost
with
an
enfeebled
hand
straight
from
the
pierglass
stepped
a
short
but
extraordinarily
broadshouldered
man
with
a
bowler
hat
on
his
head
and
a
fang
sticking
out
of
his
mouth
which
made
still
uglier
a
physiognomy
unprecedentedly
loathsome
without
that
and
with
flaming
red
hair
besides
generally
this
new
one
entered
into
the
conversation
i
don
t
understand
how
he
got
to
be
a
director
the
redhead
s
nasal
twang
was
growing
stronger
and
stronger
he
s
as
much
a
director
as
i
m
a
bishop
you
don
t
look
like
a
bishop
azazello
the
cat
observed
heaping
his
plate
with
frankfurters
that
s
what
i
mean
twanged
the
redhead
and
turning
to
woland
he
added
deferentially
allow
me
messire
to
chuck
him
the
devil
out
of
moscow
scat
the
cat
barked
suddenly
bristling
his
fur
and
then
the
bedroom
started
spinning
around
styopa
he
hit
his
head
against
the
doorpost
and
losing
consciousness
thought
i
m
dying
but
he
did
not
die
opening
his
eyes
slightly
he
saw
himself
sitting
on
something
made
of
stone
around
him
something
was
making
noise
when
he
opened
his
eyes
properly
he
realized
that
the
noise
was
being
made
by
the
sea
and
what
s
more
that
the
waves
were
rocking
just
at
his
feet
that
he
was
in
short
sitting
at
the
very
end
of
a
jetty
that
over
him
was
a
brilliant
blue
sky
and
behind
him
a
white
city
on
the
mountains
not
knowing
how
to
behave
in
such
a
case
styopa
got
up
on
his
trembling
legs
and
walked
along
the
jetty
towards
the
shore
some
man
was
standing
on
the
jetty
smoking
and
spitting
into
the
sea
he
looked
at
styopa
with
wild
eyes
and
stopped
spitting
then
styopa
pulled
the
following
stunt
he
knelt
down
before
the
unknown
smoker
and
said
i
implore
you
tell
me
what
city
is
this
really
said
the
heartless
smoker
i
m
not
drunk
styopa
replied
hoarsely
something
s
happened
to
me
i
m
ill
where
am
i
what
city
is
this
well
it
s
yalta
styopa
quietly
gasped
and
sank
down
on
his
side
his
head
striking
the
warm
stone
of
the
jetty
consciousness
left
him
chapter
the
combat
between
the
professor
and
the
poet
at
the
same
time
that
consciousness
left
styopa
in
yalta
that
is
around
half
past
eleven
in
the
morning
it
returned
to
ivan
nikolaevich
homeless
who
woke
up
after
a
long
and
deep
sleep
he
spent
some
time
pondering
how
it
was
that
he
had
wound
up
in
an
unfamiliar
room
with
white
walls
with
an
astonishing
night
table
made
of
some
light
metal
and
with
white
blinds
behind
which
one
could
sense
the
sun
ivan
shook
his
head
ascertained
that
it
did
not
ache
and
remembered
that
he
was
in
a
clinic
this
thought
drew
after
it
the
remembrance
of
berlioz
s
death
but
today
it
did
not
provoke
a
strong
shock
in
ivan
having
had
a
good
sleep
ivan
nikolaevich
became
calmer
and
began
to
think
more
clearly
after
lying
motionless
for
some
time
in
this
most
clean
soft
and
comfortable
spring
bed
ivan
noticed
a
bell
button
beside
him
from
a
habit
of
touching
things
needlessly
ivan
pressed
it
he
expected
the
pressing
of
the
button
to
be
followed
by
some
ringing
or
appearance
but
something
entirely
different
happened
a
frosted
glass
cylinder
with
the
word
drink
on
it
lit
up
at
the
foot
of
ivan
s
bed
after
pausing
for
a
while
the
cylinder
began
to
rotate
until
the
word
nurse
popped
out
it
goes
without
saying
that
the
clever
cylinder
amazed
ivan
the
word
nurse
was
replaced
by
the
words
call
the
doctor
hm
said
ivan
not
knowing
how
to
proceed
further
with
this
cylinder
but
here
he
happened
to
be
lucky
ivan
pressed
the
button
a
second
time
at
the
word
attendant
the
cylinder
rang
quietly
in
response
stopped
the
light
went
out
and
a
plump
sympathetic
woman
in
a
clean
white
coatcame
into
the
room
and
said
to
ivan
good
morning
ivan
did
not
reply
considering
such
a
greeting
inappropriate
under
the
circumstances
indeed
they
lock
up
a
healthy
man
in
a
clinic
and
pretend
that
that
is
how
it
ought
to
be
the
woman
meanwhile
without
losing
her
goodnatured
expression
brought
the
blinds
up
with
one
push
of
a
button
and
sun
flooded
the
room
through
a
light
and
widemeshed
grille
which
reached
right
to
the
floor
beyond
the
grille
a
balcony
came
into
view
beyond
that
the
bank
of
a
meandering
river
and
on
its
other
bank
a
cheerful
pine
wood
time
for
our
bath
the
woman
invited
and
under
her
hands
the
inner
wall
parted
revealing
behind
it
a
bathroom
and
splendidly
equipped
toilet
ivan
though
he
had
resolved
not
to
talk
to
the
woman
could
not
help
himself
and
on
seeing
the
water
gush
into
the
tub
in
a
wide
stream
from
the
gleaming
faucet
said
ironically
looky
there
just
like
the
metropol
oh
no
the
woman
answered
proudly
much
better
there
is
no
such
equipment
even
anywhere
abroad
scientists
and
doctors
come
especially
to
study
our
clinic
we
have
foreign
tourists
every
day
at
the
words
foreign
tourists
ivan
at
once
remembered
yesterday
s
consultant
ivan
darkened
looked
sullen
and
said
foreign
tourists
how
you
all
adore
foreign
tourists
but
among
them
incidentally
you
come
across
all
sorts
i
for
instance
met
one
yesterday
quite
something
and
he
almost
started
telling
about
pontius
pilate
but
restrained
himself
realizing
that
the
woman
had
no
use
for
these
stories
that
in
any
case
she
could
not
help
him
the
washed
ivan
nikolaevich
was
straight
away
issued
decidedly
everything
a
man
needs
after
a
bath
an
ironed
shirt
drawers
socks
and
not
only
that
opening
the
door
of
a
cupboard
the
woman
pointed
inside
and
asked
what
would
you
like
to
put
on
a
dressing
gown
or
some
nice
pyjamas
attached
to
his
new
dwelling
by
force
ivan
almost
clasped
his
hands
at
the
woman
s
casualness
and
silently
pointed
his
finger
at
the
crimson
flannel
pyjamas
after
this
ivan
nikolaevich
was
led
down
the
empty
and
noiseless
corridor
and
brought
to
an
examining
room
of
huge
dimensions
ivan
having
decided
to
take
an
ironic
attitude
towards
everything
to
be
found
in
this
wondrously
equipped
building
at
once
mentally
christened
this
room
the
industrial
kitchen
and
with
good
reason
here
stood
cabinets
and
glass
cases
with
gleaming
nickelplated
instruments
there
were
chairs
of
extraordinarily
complex
construction
some
potbellied
lamps
with
shiny
shades
a
myriad
of
phials
bunsen
burners
electric
cords
and
appliances
quite
unknown
to
anyone
in
the
examining
room
ivan
was
taken
over
by
three
persons
two
women
and
a
man
all
in
white
first
they
led
ivan
to
a
comer
to
a
little
table
with
the
obvious
purpose
of
getting
something
or
other
out
of
him
ivan
began
to
ponder
the
situation
three
ways
stood
before
him
the
first
was
extremely
tempting
to
hurl
himself
at
all
these
lamps
and
sophisticated
little
things
make
the
devil
s
own
wreck
of
them
and
thereby
express
his
protest
at
being
detained
for
nothing
but
today
s
ivan
already
differed
significantly
from
the
ivan
of
yesterday
and
this
first
way
appeared
dubious
to
him
for
all
he
knew
the
thought
might
get
rooted
in
them
that
he
was
a
violent
madman
therefore
ivan
rejected
the
first
way
there
was
a
second
immediately
to
begin
his
account
of
the
consultant
and
pontius
pilate
however
yesterday
s
experience
showed
that
this
story
either
was
not
believed
or
was
taken
somehow
perversely
therefore
ivan
renounced
this
second
way
as
well
deciding
to
choose
the
third
way
withdrawal
into
proud
silence
he
did
not
succeed
in
realizing
it
fully
and
had
willynilly
to
answer
though
charily
and
glumly
a
whole
series
of
questions
thus
they
got
out
of
ivan
decidedly
everything
about
his
past
life
down
to
when
and
how
he
had
fallen
ill
with
scarlet
fever
fifteen
years
ago
a
whole
page
having
been
covered
with
writing
about
ivan
it
was
turned
over
and
the
woman
in
white
went
on
to
questions
about
ivan
s
relatives
some
sort
of
humdrum
started
who
died
when
and
why
and
whether
he
drank
or
had
venereal
disease
and
more
of
the
same
in
conclusion
he
was
asked
to
tell
about
yesterday
s
events
at
the
patriarch
s
ponds
but
they
did
not
pester
him
too
much
and
were
not
surprised
at
the
information
about
pontius
pilate
here
the
woman
yielded
ivan
up
to
the
man
who
went
to
work
on
him
differently
and
no
longer
asked
any
questions
he
took
the
temperature
of
ivan
s
body
counted
his
pulse
looked
in
ivan
s
eyes
directing
some
sort
of
lamp
into
them
then
the
second
woman
came
to
the
man
s
assistance
and
they
pricked
ivan
in
the
back
with
something
but
not
painfully
drew
some
signs
on
the
skin
of
his
chest
with
the
handle
of
a
little
hammer
tapped
his
knees
with
the
hammer
which
made
ivan
s
legs
jump
pricked
his
finger
and
took
his
blood
pricked
him
inside
his
bent
elbow
put
some
rubber
bracelets
on
his
arms
ivan
just
smiled
bitterly
to
himself
and
reflected
on
how
stupidly
and
strangely
it
had
all
happened
just
think
he
had
wanted
to
warn
them
all
of
the
danger
threatening
from
the
unknown
consultant
had
intended
to
catch
him
and
all
he
had
achieved
was
to
wind
up
in
some
mysterious
room
telling
all
sorts
of
hogwash
about
uncle
fyodor
who
had
done
some
hard
drinking
in
vologda
insufferably
stupid
finally
ivan
was
released
he
was
escorted
back
to
his
room
where
he
was
given
a
cup
of
coffee
two
softboiled
eggs
and
white
bread
with
butter
having
eaten
and
drunk
all
that
was
offered
him
ivan
decided
to
wait
for
whoever
was
chief
of
this
institution
and
from
this
chief
to
obtain
both
attention
for
himself
and
justice
and
he
did
come
and
very
soon
after
ivan
s
breakfast
unexpectedly
the
door
of
ivan
s
room
opened
and
in
came
a
lot
of
people
in
white
coats
at
their
head
walked
a
man
of
about
fortyfive
as
carefully
shaven
as
an
actor
with
pleasant
but
quite
piercing
eyes
and
courteous
manners
the
whole
retinue
showed
him
tokens
of
attention
and
respect
and
his
entrance
therefore
came
out
very
solemn
like
pontius
pilate
thought
ivan
yes
this
was
unquestionably
the
chief
he
sat
down
on
a
stool
while
everyone
else
remained
standing
doctor
stravinsky
the
seated
man
introduced
himself
to
ivan
and
gave
him
a
friendly
look
here
alexander
nikolaevich
someone
with
a
trim
beard
said
in
a
low
voice
and
handed
the
chief
ivan
s
chart
all
covered
with
writing
they
ve
sewn
up
a
whole
case
ivan
thought
and
the
chief
ran
through
the
chart
with
a
practised
eye
muttered
mmhm
mmhm
and
exchanged
a
few
phrases
with
those
around
him
in
a
littleknown
language
and
he
speaks
latin
like
pilate
ivan
thought
sadly
here
one
word
made
him
jump
it
was
the
word
schizophrenia
alas
already
uttered
yesterday
by
the
cursed
foreigner
at
the
patriarch
s
ponds
and
now
repeated
today
by
professor
stravinsky
and
he
knew
that
too
ivan
thought
anxiously
the
chief
apparently
made
it
a
rule
to
agree
with
and
rejoice
over
everything
said
to
him
by
those
around
him
and
to
express
this
with
the
words
very
nice
very
nice
very
nice
said
stravinsky
handing
the
chart
back
to
someone
and
he
addressed
ivan
you
are
a
poet
a
poet
ivan
replied
glumly
and
for
the
first
time
suddenly
felt
some
inexplicable
loathing
for
poetry
and
his
own
verses
coming
to
mind
at
once
seemed
to
him
for
some
reason
distasteful
wrinkling
his
face
he
asked
stravinsky
in
turn
you
are
a
professor
to
this
stravinsky
with
obliging
courtesy
inclined
his
head
and
you
re
the
chief
here
ivan
continued
stravinsky
nodded
to
this
as
well
i
must
speak
with
you
ivan
nikolaevich
said
meaningly
that
is
what
i
m
here
for
returned
stravinsky
the
thing
is
ivan
began
feeling
his
hour
had
come
that
i
ve
been
got
up
as
a
madman
and
nobody
wants
to
listen
to
me
oh
no
we
shall
hear
you
out
with
great
attention
stravinsky
said
seriously
and
soothingly
and
by
no
means
allow
you
to
be
got
up
as
a
madman
listen
then
yesterday
evening
i
met
a
mysterious
person
at
the
patriarch
s
ponds
maybe
a
foreigner
maybe
not
who
knew
beforehand
about
berlioz
s
death
and
has
seen
pontius
pilate
in
person
the
retinue
listened
to
the
poet
silently
and
without
stirring
pilate
the
pilate
who
lived
in
the
time
of
jesus
christ
stravinsky
asked
narrowing
his
eyes
at
ivan
the
same
aha
said
stravinsky
and
this
berlioz
died
under
a
tramcar
precisely
he
s
the
one
who
in
my
presence
was
killed
by
a
tramcar
yesterday
at
the
ponds
and
this
same
mysterious
citizen
the
acquaintance
of
pontius
pilate
asked
stravinsky
apparently
distinguished
by
great
mental
alacrity
precisely
him
ivan
confirmed
studying
stravinsky
well
so
he
said
beforehand
that
annushka
had
spilled
the
sunflower
oil
and
he
slipped
right
on
that
place
how
do
you
like
that
ivan
inquired
significantly
hoping
to
produce
a
great
effect
with
his
words
but
the
effect
did
not
ensue
and
stravinsky
quite
simply
asked
the
following
question
and
who
is
this
annushka
this
question
upset
ivan
a
little
his
face
twitched
annushka
is
of
absolutely
no
importance
here
he
said
nervously
devil
knows
who
she
is
just
some
fool
from
sadovaya
what
s
important
is
that
he
knew
beforehand
you
see
beforehand
about
the
sunflower
oil
do
you
understand
me
perfectly
stravinsky
replied
seriously
and
touching
the
poet
s
knee
added
don
t
get
excited
just
continue
to
continue
said
ivan
trying
to
fall
in
with
stravinsky
s
tone
and
knowing
already
from
bitter
experience
that
only
calm
would
help
him
so
then
this
horrible
type
and
he
s
lying
that
he
s
a
consultant
has
some
extraordinary
power
for
instance
you
chase
after
him
and
it
s
impossible
to
catch
up
with
him
and
there
s
also
a
little
pair
with
him
good
ones
too
but
in
their
own
way
some
long
one
in
broken
glasses
and
besides
him
a
cat
of
incredible
size
who
rides
the
tram
all
by
himself
and
besides
interrupted
by
no
one
ivan
went
on
talking
with
ever
increasing
ardour
and
conviction
he
was
personally
on
pontius
pilate
s
balcony
there
s
no
doubt
of
it
so
what
is
all
this
eh
he
must
be
arrested
immediately
otherwise
he
ll
do
untold
harm
so
you
re
trying
to
get
him
arrested
have
i
understood
you
correctly
asked
stravinsky
he
s
intelligent
thought
ivan
you
ve
got
to
admit
even
among
intellectuals
you
come
across
some
of
rare
intelligence
there
s
no
denying
it
and
he
replied
quite
correctly
and
how
could
i
not
be
trying
just
consider
for
yourself
and
meanwhile
i
ve
been
forcibly
detained
here
they
poke
lamps
into
my
eyes
give
me
baths
question
me
for
some
reason
about
my
uncle
fedya
and
he
departed
this
world
long
ago
i
demand
to
be
released
immediately
well
there
very
nice
very
nice
stravinsky
responded
now
everything
s
clear
really
what
s
the
sense
of
keeping
a
healthy
man
in
a
clinic
very
well
sir
i
ll
check
you
out
of
here
right
now
if
you
tell
me
you
re
normal
not
prove
but
merely
tell
so
then
are
you
normal
here
complete
silence
fell
and
the
fat
woman
who
had
taken
care
of
ivan
in
the
morning
looked
at
the
professor
with
awe
ivan
thought
once
again
positively
intelligent
the
professor
s
offer
pleased
him
very
much
yet
before
replying
he
thought
very
very
hard
wrinkling
his
forehead
and
at
last
said
firmly
i
am
normal
well
how
very
nice
stravinsky
exclaimed
with
relief
and
if
so
let
s
reason
logically
let
s
take
your
day
yesterday
here
he
turned
and
ivan
s
chart
was
immediately
handed
to
him
in
search
of
an
unknown
man
who
recommended
himself
as
an
acquaintance
of
pontius
pilate
you
performed
the
following
actions
yesterday
here
stravinsky
began
holding
up
his
long
fingers
glancing
now
at
the
chart
now
at
ivan
you
hung
a
little
icon
on
your
chest
did
you
i
did
ivan
agreed
sullenly
you
fell
off
a
fence
and
hurt
your
face
right
showed
up
in
a
restaurant
carrying
a
burning
candle
in
your
hand
in
nothing
but
your
underwear
and
in
the
restaurant
you
beat
somebody
you
were
brought
heretied
up
having
come
here
you
called
the
police
and
asked
them
to
send
out
machineguns
then
you
attempted
to
throw
yourself
out
the
window
right
the
question
is
can
one
by
acting
in
such
fashion
catch
or
arrest
anyone
and
if
you
re
a
normal
man
you
yourself
will
answer
by
no
means
you
wish
to
leave
here
very
well
sir
but
allow
me
to
ask
where
are
you
going
to
go
to
the
police
of
course
ivan
replied
no
longer
so
firmly
and
somewhat
at
a
loss
under
the
professor
s
gaze
straight
from
here
mmhm
without
stopping
at
your
place
stravinsky
asked
quickly
i
have
no
time
to
stop
anywhere
while
i
m
stopping
at
places
he
ll
slip
away
so
and
what
will
you
tell
the
police
to
start
with
about
pontius
pilate
ivan
nikolaevich
replied
and
his
eyes
clouded
with
a
gloomy
mist
well
how
very
nice
the
wonover
stravinsky
exclaimed
and
turning
to
the
one
with
the
little
beard
ordered
fyodor
vassilyevich
please
check
citizen
homeless
out
for
town
but
don
t
put
anyone
in
his
room
or
change
the
linen
in
two
hours
citizen
homeless
will
be
back
here
so
then
he
turned
to
the
poet
i
won
t
wish
you
success
because
i
don
t
believe
one
iota
in
that
success
seeyou
soon
he
stood
up
and
his
retinue
stirred
on
what
grounds
will
i
be
back
here
ivan
asked
anxiously
stravinsky
was
as
if
waiting
for
this
question
immediately
sat
down
and
began
to
speak
on
the
grounds
that
as
soon
as
you
show
up
at
the
police
station
in
your
drawers
and
tell
them
you
ve
seen
a
man
who
knew
pontius
pilate
personally
you
ll
instantly
be
brought
here
and
you
ll
find
yourself
again
in
this
very
same
room
what
have
drawers
got
to
do
with
it
ivan
asked
gazing
around
in
bewilderment
it
s
mainly
pontius
pilate
but
the
drawers
too
because
we
ll
take
the
clinic
underwear
from
you
and
give
you
back
your
clothes
and
you
were
delivered
here
in
your
drawers
and
yet
you
were
by
no
means
going
to
stop
at
your
place
though
i
dropped
you
a
hint
then
comes
pilate
and
that
s
it
here
something
strange
happened
with
ivan
nikolaevich
his
will
seemed
to
crack
and
he
felt
himself
weak
in
need
of
advice
what
am
i
to
do
then
he
asked
timidly
this
time
well
how
very
nice
stravinsky
replied
a
most
reasonable
question
now
i
am
going
to
tell
you
what
actually
happened
to
you
yesterday
someone
frightened
you
badly
and
upset
you
with
a
story
about
pontius
pilate
and
other
things
and
so
you
a
very
nervous
and
highstrung
man
started
going
around
the
city
telling
about
pontius
pilate
it
s
quite
natural
that
you
re
taken
for
a
madman
your
salvation
now
lies
in
just
one
thing
complete
peace
and
you
absolutely
must
remain
here
but
he
has
to
be
caught
ivan
exclaimed
imploringly
now
very
good
sir
but
why
should
you
go
running
around
yourself
explain
all
your
suspicions
and
accusations
against
this
man
on
paper
nothing
could
be
simpler
than
to
send
your
declaration
to
the
proper
quarters
and
if
as
you
think
we
are
dealing
with
a
criminal
it
will
be
clarified
very
quickly
but
only
on
one
condition
don
t
strain
your
head
and
try
to
think
less
about
pontius
pilate
people
say
all
kinds
of
things
one
mustn
t
believe
everything
understood
ivan
declared
resolutely
i
ask
to
be
given
pen
and
paper
give
him
paper
and
a
short
pencil
stravinsky
ordered
the
fat
woman
and
to
ivan
he
said
but
i
don
t
advise
you
to
write
today
no
no
today
today
without
fail
ivan
cried
out
in
alarm
well
all
right
only
don
t
strain
your
head
if
it
doesn
t
come
out
today
it
will
tomorrow
hell
escape
oh
no
stravinsky
objected
confidently
he
won
t
escape
anywhere
i
guarantee
that
and
remember
that
here
with
us
you
ll
be
helped
in
all
possible
ways
and
without
us
nothing
will
come
of
it
do
you
hear
me
stravinsky
suddenly
asked
meaningly
and
took
ivan
nikolaevich
by
both
hands
holding
them
in
his
own
he
repeated
for
a
long
time
his
eyes
fixed
on
ivan
s
you
ll
be
helped
here
do
you
hear
me
you
ll
be
helped
here
you
ll
get
relief
it
s
quiet
here
all
peaceful
you
ll
be
helped
here
ivan
nikolaevich
unexpectedly
yawned
and
the
expression
on
his
face
softened
yes
yes
he
said
quietly
well
how
very
nice
stravinsky
concluded
the
conversation
in
his
usual
way
and
stood
up
goodbye
he
shook
ivan
s
hand
and
on
his
way
out
turned
to
the
one
with
the
little
beard
and
said
yes
and
try
oxygen
and
baths
a
few
moments
later
there
was
no
stravinsky
or
his
retinue
before
ivan
beyond
the
window
grille
in
the
noonday
sun
the
joyful
and
springtime
pine
wood
stood
beautiful
on
the
other
bank
and
closer
by
the
river
sparkled
chapter
koroviev
s
stunts
nikanor
ivanovich
bosoy
chairman
of
the
tenants
association
of
no
bis
on
sadovaya
street
in
moscow
where
the
late
berlioz
used
to
reside
had
been
having
the
most
terrible
troubles
starting
from
that
wednesday
night
at
midnight
as
we
already
know
a
commission
of
which
zheldybin
formed
a
part
came
to
the
house
summoned
nikanor
ivanovich
told
him
about
the
death
of
berlioz
and
together
with
him
went
to
apartment
no
there
the
sealing
of
the
deceased
s
manuscripts
and
belongings
was
carried
out
neither
grunya
the
daytime
housekeeper
nor
the
lightminded
stepan
bogdanovich
was
there
at
the
time
the
commission
announced
to
nikanor
ivanovich
that
it
would
take
the
deceased
s
manuscripts
for
sorting
out
that
his
living
space
that
is
three
rooms
the
former
study
living
room
and
dining
room
of
the
jeweller
s
wife
reverted
to
the
disposal
of
the
tenants
association
and
that
the
belongings
were
to
be
kept
in
the
aforementioned
living
space
until
the
heirs
were
announced
the
news
of
berlioz
s
death
spread
through
the
whole
house
with
a
sort
of
supernatural
speed
and
as
of
seven
o
clock
thursday
morning
bosoy
began
to
receive
telephone
calls
and
then
personal
visits
with
declarations
containing
claims
to
the
deceased
s
living
space
in
the
period
of
two
hours
nikanor
ivanovich
received
thirtytwo
such
declarations
they
contained
pleas
threats
libels
denunciations
promises
to
do
renovations
at
their
own
expense
references
to
unbearable
overcrowding
and
the
impossibility
of
living
in
the
same
apartment
with
bandits
among
others
there
were
a
description
staggering
in
its
artistic
power
of
the
theft
from
apartment
no
of
some
meat
dumplings
tucked
directly
into
the
pocket
of
a
suit
jacket
two
vows
to
end
life
by
suicide
and
one
confession
of
secret
pregnancy
nikanor
ivanovich
was
called
out
to
the
front
hall
of
his
apartment
plucked
by
the
sleeve
whispered
to
winked
at
promised
that
he
would
not
be
left
the
loser
this
torture
went
on
until
noon
when
nikanor
ivanovich
simply
fled
his
apartment
for
the
management
office
by
the
gate
but
when
he
saw
them
lying
in
wait
for
him
there
too
he
fled
that
place
as
well
having
somehow
shaken
off
those
who
followed
on
his
heels
across
the
asphaltpaved
courtyard
nikanor
ivanovich
disappeared
into
the
sixth
entrance
and
went
up
to
the
fifth
floor
where
this
vile
apartment
no
was
located
after
catching
his
breath
on
the
landing
the
corpulent
nikanor
ivanovich
rang
but
no
one
opened
for
him
he
rang
again
and
then
again
and
started
grumbling
and
swearing
quietly
even
then
no
one
opened
his
patience
exhausted
nikanor
ivanovich
took
from
his
pocket
a
bunch
of
duplicate
keys
belonging
to
the
house
management
opened
the
door
with
a
sovereign
hand
and
went
in
hey
housekeeper
nikanor
ivanovich
cried
in
the
semidark
front
hall
grunya
or
whatever
your
name
is
are
you
here
no
one
responded
then
nikanor
ivanovich
took
a
folding
ruler
from
his
briefcase
removed
the
seal
from
the
door
to
the
study
and
stepped
in
stepped
in
yes
but
halted
in
amazement
in
the
doorway
and
even
gave
a
start
at
the
deceased
s
desk
sat
an
unknown
skinny
long
citizen
in
a
little
checkered
jacket
a
jockey
s
cap
and
a
pincenez
well
in
short
that
same
one
and
who
might
you
be
citizen
nikanor
ivanovich
asked
fearfully
hah
nikanor
ivanovich
the
unexpected
citizen
yelled
in
a
rattling
tenor
and
jumping
up
greeted
the
chairman
with
a
forced
and
sudden
handshake
this
greeting
by
no
means
gladdened
nikanor
ivanovich
excuse
me
he
said
suspiciously
but
who
might
you
be
are
you
an
official
person
eh
nikanor
ivanovich
the
unknown
man
exclaimed
soulfully
what
are
official
and
unofficial
persons
it
all
depends
on
your
point
of
view
on
the
subject
it
s
all
fluctuating
and
relative
nikanor
ivanovich
today
i
m
an
unofficial
person
and
tomorrow
lo
and
behold
i
m
an
official
one
and
it
also
happens
the
other
way
round
oh
how
it
does
this
argument
in
no
way
satisfied
the
chairman
of
the
house
management
being
a
generally
suspicious
person
by
nature
he
concluded
that
the
man
holding
forth
in
front
of
him
was
precisely
an
unofficial
person
and
perhaps
even
an
idle
one
yes
but
who
might
you
be
what
s
your
name
the
chairman
inquired
with
increasing
severity
and
even
began
to
advance
upon
the
unknown
man
my
name
the
citizen
responded
not
a
bit
put
out
by
the
severity
well
let
s
say
it
s
koroviev
but
wouldn
t
you
like
a
little
snack
nikanor
ivanovich
no
formalities
eh
excuse
me
nikanor
ivanovich
began
indignantly
now
what
have
snacks
got
to
do
with
it
we
must
confess
unpleasant
as
it
is
that
nikanor
ivanovich
was
of
a
somewhat
rude
nature
sitting
in
the
deceased
s
half
is
not
permitted
what
are
you
doing
here
have
a
seat
nikanor
ivanovich
the
citizen
went
on
yelling
not
a
bit
at
a
loss
and
began
fussing
about
offering
the
chairman
a
seat
utterly
infuriated
nikanor
ivanovich
rejected
the
seat
and
screamed
but
who
are
you
i
if
you
please
serve
as
interpreter
for
a
foreign
individual
who
has
taken
up
residence
in
this
apartment
the
man
calling
himself
koroviev
introduced
himself
and
clicked
the
heels
of
his
scuffed
unpolished
shoes
nikanor
ivanovich
opened
his
mouth
the
presence
of
some
foreigner
in
this
apartment
with
an
interpreter
to
boot
came
as
a
complete
surprise
to
him
and
he
demanded
explanations
the
interpreter
explained
willingly
a
foreign
artiste
mr
woland
had
been
kindly
invited
by
the
director
of
the
variety
stepan
bogdanovich
likhodeev
to
spend
the
time
of
his
performances
a
week
or
so
in
his
apartment
about
which
he
had
written
to
nikanor
ivanovich
yesterday
requesting
that
he
register
the
foreigner
as
a
temporary
resident
while
likhodeev
himself
took
a
trip
to
yalta
he
never
wrote
me
anything
the
chairman
said
in
amazement
just
look
through
your
briefcase
nikanor
ivanovich
koroviev
suggested
sweetly
nikanor
ivanovich
shrugging
his
shoulders
opened
the
briefcase
and
found
likhodeev
s
letter
in
it
how
could
i
have
forgotten
about
it
nikanor
ivanovich
muttered
looking
dully
at
the
opened
envelope
all
sorts
of
things
happen
nikanor
ivanovich
all
sorts
koroviev
rattled
absentmindedness
absentmindedness
fatigue
and
high
blood
pressure
my
dear
friend
nikanor
ivanovich
i
m
terribly
absentminded
myself
someday
over
a
glass
i
ll
tell
you
a
few
facts
from
my
biography
you
ll
die
laughing
and
when
is
likhodeev
going
to
yalta
he
s
already
gone
gone
the
interpreter
cried
he
s
already
wheeling
along
you
know
he
s
already
devil
knows
where
and
here
the
interpreter
waved
his
arms
like
the
wings
of
a
windmill
nikanor
ivanovich
declared
that
he
must
see
the
foreigner
in
person
but
got
a
refusal
on
that
from
the
interpreter
quite
impossible
he
s
busy
training
the
cat
the
cat
i
can
show
you
if
you
like
koroviev
offered
this
nikanor
ivanovich
refused
in
his
turn
and
the
interpreter
straight
away
made
the
chairman
an
unexpected
but
quite
interesting
proposal
seeing
that
mr
woland
had
no
desire
whatsoever
to
live
in
a
hotel
and
was
accustomed
to
having
a
lot
of
space
why
shouldn
t
the
tenants
association
rent
to
him
woland
for
one
little
week
the
time
of
his
performances
in
moscow
the
whole
of
the
apartment
that
is
the
deceased
s
rooms
as
well
it
s
all
the
same
to
him
the
deceased
you
must
agree
nikanor
ivanovich
koroviev
whispered
hoarsely
he
doesn
t
need
the
apartment
now
does
he
nikanor
ivanovich
somewhat
perplexed
objected
that
foreigners
ought
to
live
at
the
metropol
and
not
in
private
apartments
at
all
i
m
telling
you
he
s
capricious
as
devil
knows
what
koroviev
whispered
he
just
doesn
t
want
to
he
doesn
t
like
hotels
i
ve
had
them
up
to
here
these
foreign
tourists
koroviev
complained
confidentially
jabbing
his
finger
at
his
sinewy
neck
believe
me
they
wring
thesoul
right
out
of
you
they
come
and
either
spy
on
you
like
the
lowest
son
of
a
bitch
or
else
torment
you
with
their
caprices
this
isn
t
right
and
that
isn
t
right
and
for
your
association
nikanor
ivanovich
it
s
a
sheer
gain
and
an
obvious
profit
he
won
t
stint
on
money
koroviev
looked
around
and
then
whispered
into
the
chairman
s
ear
a
millionaire
the
interpreter
s
offer
made
clear
practical
sense
it
was
a
very
solid
offer
yet
there
was
something
remarkably
unsolid
in
his
manner
of
speaking
and
in
his
clothes
and
in
that
loathsome
goodfornothing
pincenez
as
a
result
something
vague
weighed
on
the
chairman
s
soul
but
he
nevertheless
decided
to
accept
the
offer
the
thing
was
that
the
tenants
association
alas
had
quite
a
sizeable
deficit
fuel
had
to
be
bought
for
the
heating
system
by
fall
but
who
was
going
to
shell
out
for
it
no
one
knew
but
with
the
foreign
tourist
s
money
it
might
be
possible
to
wriggle
out
of
it
however
the
practical
and
prudent
nikanor
ivanovich
said
he
would
first
have
to
settle
the
question
with
the
foreign
tourist
bureau
i
understand
koroviev
cried
out
you
ve
got
to
settle
it
absolutely
here
s
the
telephone
nikanor
ivanovich
settle
it
at
once
and
don
t
be
shy
about
the
money
he
added
in
a
whisper
drawing
the
chairman
to
the
telephone
in
the
front
hall
if
he
won
t
pay
who
will
you
should
see
the
villa
he
s
got
in
nice
next
summer
when
you
go
abroad
come
especially
to
see
it
you
ll
gasp
the
business
with
the
foreign
tourist
bureau
was
arranged
over
the
phone
with
an
extraordinary
speed
quite
amazing
to
the
chairman
it
turned
out
that
they
already
knew
about
mr
woland
s
intention
of
staying
in
likhodeev
s
private
apartment
and
had
no
objections
to
it
that
s
wonderful
koroviev
yelled
somewhat
stunned
by
his
chatter
the
chairman
announced
that
the
tenants
association
agreed
to
rent
apartment
no
for
a
week
to
the
artiste
woland
for
nikanor
ivanovich
faltered
a
little
then
said
for
five
hundred
roubles
a
day
here
koroviev
utterly
amazed
the
chairman
winking
thievishly
in
the
direction
of
the
bedroom
from
which
the
soft
leaps
of
a
heavy
cat
could
be
heard
he
rasped
out
so
it
comes
to
three
thousand
five
hundred
for
the
week
to
which
nikanor
ivanovich
thought
he
was
going
to
add
some
appetite
you
ve
got
nikanor
ivanovich
but
koroviev
said
something
quite
different
what
kind
of
money
is
that
ask
five
he
ll
pay
it
grinning
perplexedly
nikanor
ivanovich
without
noticing
how
found
himself
at
the
deceased
s
writing
desk
where
koroviev
with
great
speed
and
dexterity
drew
up
a
contract
in
two
copies
then
he
flew
to
the
bedroom
with
them
and
came
back
both
copies
now
bearing
the
foreigner
s
sweeping
signature
the
chairman
also
signed
the
contract
here
koroviev
asked
for
a
receipt
for
five
write
it
out
write
it
out
nikanor
ivanovich
thousand
roubles
and
with
words
somehow
unsuited
to
serious
business
ein
zwei
drei
he
laid
out
for
the
chairman
five
stacks
of
new
banknotes
the
countingup
took
place
interspersed
with
koroviev
s
quips
and
quiddities
such
as
cash
loves
counting
your
own
eye
won
t
lie
and
others
of
the
same
sort
after
counting
the
money
the
chairman
received
from
koroviev
the
foreigner
s
passport
for
temporary
registration
put
it
together
with
the
contract
and
the
money
into
his
briefcase
and
somehow
unable
to
help
himself
sheepishly
asked
for
a
free
pass
don
t
mention
it
bellowed
koroviev
how
many
tickets
do
you
want
nikanor
ivanovich
twelve
fifteen
the
flabbergasted
chairman
explained
that
all
he
needed
was
a
couple
of
passes
for
himself
and
pelageya
antonovna
his
wife
koroviev
snatched
out
a
notebook
at
once
and
dashed
off
a
pass
for
nikanor
ivanovich
for
two
persons
in
the
front
row
and
with
his
left
hand
the
interpreter
deftly
slipped
this
pass
to
nikanor
ivanovich
while
with
his
right
he
put
into
the
chairman
s
other
hand
a
thick
crackling
wad
casting
an
eye
on
it
nikanor
ivanovich
blushed
deeply
and
began
to
push
it
away
it
isn
t
done
he
murmured
i
won
t
hear
of
it
koroviev
whispered
right
in
his
ear
with
us
it
s
not
done
but
with
foreigners
it
is
you
ll
offend
him
nikanor
ivanovich
and
that
s
embarrassing
you
ve
worked
hard
it
s
severely
punishable
the
chairman
whispered
very
very
softly
and
glanced
over
his
shoulder
but
where
are
the
witnesses
koroviev
whispered
into
his
other
ear
i
ask
you
where
are
they
you
don
t
think
here
as
the
chairman
insisted
afterwards
a
miracle
occurred
the
wad
crept
into
his
briefcase
by
itself
and
then
the
chairman
somehow
limp
and
even
broken
found
himself
on
the
stairs
a
whirlwind
of
thoughts
raged
in
his
head
there
was
the
villa
in
nice
and
the
trained
cat
and
the
thought
that
there
were
in
fact
no
witnesses
and
that
pelageya
antonovna
would
be
delighted
with
the
pass
they
were
incoherent
thoughts
but
generally
pleasant
but
all
the
same
somewhere
some
little
needle
kept
pricking
the
chairman
in
the
very
bottom
of
his
soul
this
was
the
needle
of
anxiety
besides
right
then
on
the
stairs
the
chairman
was
seized
as
with
a
stroke
by
the
thought
but
how
did
the
interpreter
get
into
the
study
if
the
door
was
sealed
and
how
was
it
that
he
nikanor
ivanovich
had
not
asked
about
it
for
some
time
the
chairman
stood
staring
like
a
sheep
at
the
steps
of
the
stairway
but
then
he
decided
to
spit
on
it
and
not
torment
himself
with
intricate
questions
as
soon
as
the
chairman
left
the
apartment
a
low
voice
came
from
the
bedroom
i
didn
t
like
this
nikanor
ivanovich
he
is
a
chiseller
and
a
crook
can
it
be
arranged
so
that
he
doesn
t
come
any
more
messire
you
have
only
to
say
the
word
koroviev
responded
from
somewhere
not
in
a
rattling
but
in
a
very
clear
and
resounding
voice
and
at
once
the
accursed
interpreter
turned
up
in
the
front
hall
dialled
a
number
there
and
for
some
reason
began
speaking
very
tearfully
into
the
receiver
hello
i
consider
it
my
duty
to
inform
you
that
the
chairman
of
our
tenants
association
at
no
bis
on
sadovaya
nikanor
ivanovich
bosoy
is
speculating
in
foreign
currency
at
the
present
moment
in
his
apartment
no
he
has
four
hundred
dollars
wrapped
up
in
newspaper
in
the
ventilation
of
the
privy
this
is
timofei
kvastsov
speaking
a
tenant
of
the
said
house
apartment
no
but
i
adjure
you
to
keep
my
name
a
secret
i
fear
the
vengeance
of
the
abovestated
chairman
and
he
hung
up
the
scoundrel
what
happened
next
in
apartment
no
is
not
known
but
it
is
known
what
happened
at
nikanor
ivanovich
s
having
locked
himself
in
the
privy
with
the
hook
he
took
from
his
briefcase
the
wad
foisted
on
him
by
the
interpreter
and
satisfied
himself
that
it
contained
four
hundred
roubles
nikanor
ivanovich
wrapped
this
wad
in
a
scrap
of
newspaper
and
put
it
into
the
ventilation
duct
five
minutes
later
the
chairman
was
sitting
at
the
table
in
his
small
dining
room
his
wife
brought
pickled
herring
from
the
kitchen
neatly
sliced
and
thickly
sprinkled
with
green
onion
nikanor
ivanovich
poured
himself
a
dram
of
vodka
drank
it
poured
another
drank
it
picked
up
three
pieces
of
herring
on
his
fork
and
at
that
moment
the
doorbell
rang
pelageya
antonovna
was
just
bringing
in
a
steaming
pot
which
one
could
tell
at
once
from
a
single
glance
contained
amidst
a
fiery
borscht
that
than
which
there
is
nothing
more
delicious
in
the
world
a
marrow
bone
swallowing
his
spittle
nikanor
ivanovich
growled
like
a
dog
damn
them
all
won
t
allow
a
man
to
eat
don
t
let
anyone
in
i
m
not

here
if

s
about
the
apartment
tell
them
to
stop
blathering
there
ll
be
a
meeting
next
week
his
wife
ran
to
the
front
hall
while
nikanor
ivanovich
using
a
ladle
drew
from
the
firebreathing
lake
it
the
bone
cracked
lengthwise
and
at
that
moment
two
citizens
entered
the
dining
room
with
pelageya
antonovna
following
them
for
some
reason
looking
very
pale
seeing
the
citizens
nikanor
ivanovich
also
turned
white
and
stood
up
where
s
the
jakes
the
first
one
in
a
white
sidebuttoned
shirt
asked
with
a
preoccupied
air
something
thudded
against
the
dining
table
this
was
nikanor
ivanovich
dropping
the
ladle
on
to
the
oilcloth
this
way
this
way
pelageya
antonovna
replied
in
a
patter
and
the
visitors
immediately
hastened
to
the
corridor
what
s
the
matter
nikanor
ivanovich
asked
quietly
going
after
the
visitors
there
can
t
be
anything
like
that
in
our
apartment
and
your
papers
begging
your
pardon
the
first
without
stopping
showed
nikanor
ivanovich
a
paper
and
the
second
was
at
the
same
moment
standing
on
a
stool
in
the
privy
his
arm
in
the
ventilation
duct
everything
went
dark
in
nikanor
ivanovich
s
eyes
the
newspaper
was
removed
but
in
the
wad
there
were
not
roubles
but
some
unknown
money
bluishgreenish
and
with
the
portrait
of
some
old
man
however
nikanor
ivanovich
saw
it
all
dimly
there
were
some
sort
of
spots
floating
in
front
of
his
eyes
dollars
in
the
ventilation
the
first
said
pensively
and
asked
nikanor
ivanovich
gently
and
courteously
tour
little
wad
no
nikanor
ivanovich
replied
in
a
dreadful
voice
enemies
stuck
me
with
it
that
happens
the
first
agreed
and
added
again
gently
well

going
to

to
turn
in
the
rest
i
haven
t
got
any
i
swear
to
god
i
never
laid
a
finger
on
it
the
chairman
cried
out
desperately
he
dashed
to
the
chest
pulled
a
drawer
out
with
a
clatter
and
from
it
the
briefcase
crying
out
incoherently
here
s
the
contract
that
vermin
of
an
interpreter
stuck
me
with
it
koroviev
in
a
pincenez
he
opened
the
briefcase
glanced
into
it
put
a
hand
inside
went
blue
in
the
face
and
dropped
the
briefcase
into
the
borscht
there
was
nothing
in
the
briefcase
no
letter
from
styopa
no
contract
no
foreigner
s
passport
no
money
no
theatre
pass
in
short
nothing
except
a
folding
ruler
comrades
the
chairman
cried
frenziedly
catch
them
there
are
unclean
powers
in
our
house
it
is
not
known
what
pelageya
antonovna
imagined
here
only
she
clasped
her
hands
and
cried
repent
ivanych
you
ll
get
off
lighter
his
eyes
bloodshot
nikanor
ivanovich
raised
his
fists
over
his
wife
s
head
croaking
ohh
you
damned
fool
here
he
went
slack
and
sank
down
on
a
chair
evidently
resolved
to
submit
to
the
inevitable
during
this
time
timofei
kondratievich
kvastsov
stood
on
the
landing
placing
now
his
ear
now
his
eye
to
the
keyhole
of
the
door
to
the
chairman
s
apartment
melting
with
curiosity
five
minutes
later
the
tenants
of
the
house
who
were
in
the
courtyard
saw
the
chairman
accompanied
by
two
other
persons
proceed
directly
to
the
gates
of
the
house
it
was
said
that
nikanor
ivanovich
looked
awful
staggered
like
a
drunk
man
as
he
passed
and
was
muttering
something
and
an
hour
after
that
an
unknown
citizen
appeared
in
apartment
no
just
as
timofei
kondratievich
spluttering
with
delight
was
telling
some
other
tenants
how
the
chairman
got
pinched
motioned
to
timofei
kondratievich
with
his
finger
to
come
from
the
kitchen
to
the
front
hall
said
something
to
him
and
together
they
vanished
chapter
news
from
yalta
at
the
same
time
that
disaster
struck
nikanor
ivanovich
not
far
away
from
no
bis
on
the
same
sadovaya
street
in
the
office
of
the
financial
director
of
the
variety
theatre
rimsky
there
sat
two
men
rimsky
himself
and
the
administrator
of
the
variety
varenukha
the
big
office
on
the
second
floor
of
the
theatre
had
two
windows
on
sadovaya
and
one
just
behind
the
back
of
the
findirector
who
was
sitting
at
his
desk
facing
the
summer
garden
of
the
variety
where
there
were
refreshment
stands
a
shooting
gallery
and
an
openair
stage
the
furnishings
of
the
office
apart
from
the
desk
consisted
of
a
bunch
of
old
posters
hanging
on
the
wall
a
small
table
with
a
carafe
of
water
on
it
four
armchairs
and
in
the
corner
a
stand
on
which
stood
a
dustcovered
scale
model
of
some
past
review
well
it
goes
without
saying
that
in
addition
there
was
in
the
office
a
small
shabby
peeling
fireproof
safe
to
rimsky
s
left
next
to
the
desk
rimsky
now
sitting
at
his
desk
had
been
in
bad
spirits
since
morning
while
varenukha
on
the
contrary
was
very
animated
and
somehow
especially
restlessly
active
yet
there
was
no
outlet
for
his
energy
varenukha
was
presently
hiding
in
the
findirector
s
office
to
escape
the
seekers
of
free
passes
who
poisoned
his
life
especially
on
days
when
the
programme
changed
and
today
was
precisely
such
a
day
as
soon
as
the
telephone
started
to
ring
varenukha
would
pick
up
the
receiver
and
lie
into
it
who
varenukha
he
s
not
here
he
stepped
out
please
call
likhodeev
again
rimsky
asked
vexedly
he
s
not
home
i
even
sent
karpov
there
s
no
one
in
the
apartment
devil
knows
what
s
going
on
rimsky
hissed
clacking
on
the
adding
machine
the
door
opened
and
an
usher
dragged
in
a
thick
stack
of
freshly
printed
extra
posters
in
big
red
letters
on
a
green
background
was
printed
today
and
every
day
at
the
variety
theatre
an
additional
programme
professor
woland
seances
of
black
magic
and
its
full
exposure
varenukha
stepped
back
from
the
poster
which
he
had
thrown
on
to
the
scale
model
admired
it
and
told
the
usher
to
send
all
the
posters
out
immediately
to
be
pasted
up
good
loud
varenukha
observed
on
the
usher
s
departure
and
i
dislike
this
undertaking
extremely
rimsky
grumbled
glancing
spitefully
at
the
poster
through
his
hornrimmed
glasses
and
generally
i
m
surprised
he
s
been
allowed
to
present
it
no
grigory
danilovich
don
t
say
so
this
is
a
very
subtle
step
the
salt
is
all
in
the
exposure
i
don
t
know
i
don
t
know
there
s
no
salt
in
my
opinion
and
he
s
always
coming
up
with
things
like
this
he
might
at
least
show
us
his
magician
have
you
seen
him
where
he
dug
him
up
devil
knows
it
turned
out
that
varenukha
had
not
seen
the
magician
any
more
than
rimsky
had
yesterday
styopa
had
come
running
like
crazy
in
rimsky
s
expression
to
the
findirector
with
the
already
written
draft
of
a
contract
ordered
it
copied
straight
away
and
the
money
handed
over
to
woland
and
this
magician
had
cleared
out
and
no
one
had
seen
him
except
styopa
himself
rimsky
took
out
his
watch
saw
that
it
read
five
minutes
past
two
and
flew
into
a
complete
rage
really
likhodeev
had
called
at
around
eleven
said
he
d
come
in
half
an
hour
and
not
only
had
not
come
but
had
disappeared
from
his
apartment
he
s
holding
up
my
business
rimsky
was
roaring
now
jabbing
his
finger
at
a
pile
of
unsigned
papers
might
he
have
fallen
under
a
tramcar
like
berlioz
varenukha
said
as
he
held
his
ear
to
the
receiver
from
which
came
low
prolonged
and
utterly
hopeless
signals
wouldn
t
be
a
bad
thing
rimsky
said
barely
audibly
through
his
teeth
at
that
same
moment
a
woman
in
a
uniform
jacket
visored
cap
black
skirt
and

came
into
the
office
from
a
small
pouch
at
her
belt
the
woman
took
a
small
white
square
and
a
notebook
and
asked
who
here
is
variety
a
superlightning
telegram
sign
here
varenukha
scribbled
some
flourish
in
the
woman
s
notebook
and
as
soon
as
the
door
slammed
behind
her
he
opened
the
square
after
reading
the
telegram
he
blinked
and
handed
the
square
to
rimsky
the
telegram
contained
the
following

where
director
likhodeev
hello

how

rimsky
exclaimed
and
added
another
surprise
a
false
dmitri
said
varenukha
and
he
spoke
into
the
receiver

office
variety
account
take

yalta
criminal
investigation
director
likhodeev
moscow
findirector
rimsky
irrespective
of
the
news
about
the
yalta
impostor
varenukha
again
began
searching
all
over
for
styopa
by
telephone
and
naturally
did
not
find
him
anywhere
just
as
varenukha
receiver
in
hand
was
pondering
where
else
he
might
call
the
same
woman
who
had
brought
the
first
telegram
came
in
and
handed
varenukha
a
new
envelope
opening
it
hurriedly
varenukha
read
the
message
and
whistled
what
now
rimsky
asked
twitching
nervously
varenukha
silently
handed
him
the
telegram
and
the
findirector
saw
there
the
words
beg
believe
thrown
yalta
woland

wire

investigation
confirm
identity
likhodeev
rimsky
and
varenukha
their
heads
touching
reread
the
telegram
and
after
rereading
it
silently
stared
at
each
other
citizens
the
woman
got
angry
sign
and
then
be
silent
as
much
as
you
like
i
deliver
lightnings
varenukha
without
taking
his
eyes
off
the
telegram
made
a
crooked
scrawl
in
the
notebook
and
the
woman
vanished
didn
t
you
talk
with
him
on
the
phone
at
a
little
past
eleven
the
administrator
began
in
total
bewilderment
no
it
s
ridiculous
rimsky
cried
shrilly
talk
or
not
he
can
t
be
in
yalta
now
it
s
ridiculous
he
s
drunk
said
varenukha
who
s
drunk
asked
rimsky
and
again
the
two
stared
at
each
other
that
some
impostor
or
madman
had
sent
telegrams
from
yalta
there
was
no
doubt
but
the
strange
thing
was
this
how
did
the
yalta
mystifier
know
woland
who
had
come
to
moscow
just
the
day
before
how
did
he
know
about
the
connection
between
likhodeev
and
woland
hypnosis
varenukha
kept
repeating
the
word
from
the
telegram
how
does
he
know
about
woland
he
blinked
his
eyes
and
suddenly
cried
resolutely
ah
no
nonsense
nonsense
nonsense
where
s
he
staying
this
woland
devil
take
him
asked
rimsky
varenukha
immediately
got
connected
with
the
foreign
tourist
bureau
and
to
rimsky
s
utter
astonishment
announced
that
woland
was
staying
in
likhodeev
s
apartment
dialling
the
number
of
the
likhodeev
apartment
after
that
varenukha
listened
for
a
long
time
to
the
low
buzzing
in
the
receiver
amidst
the
buzzing
from
somewhere
far
away
came
a
heavy
gloomy
voice
singing
rocks
my
refuge
and
varenukha
decided
that
the
telephone
lines
had
crossed
with
a
voice
from
a
radio
show
the
apartment
doesn
t
answer
varenukha
said
putting
down
the
receiver
or
maybe
i
should
call
he
did
not
finish
the
same
woman
appeared
in
the
door
and
both
men
rimsky
and
varenukha
rose
to
meet
her
while
she
took
from
her
pouch
not
a
white
sheet
this
time
but
some
sort
of
dark
one
this
is
beginning
to
get
interesting
varenukha
said
through
his
teeth
his
eyes
following
the
hurriedly
departing
woman
rimsky
was
the
first
to
take
hold
of
the
sheet
on
a
dark
background
of
photographic
paper
some
black
handwritten
lines
were
barely
discernible
proof
my
handwriting
my
signature
wire
urgently
confirmation
place
secret
watch
woland
likhodeev
in
his
twenty
years
of
work
in
the
theatre
varenukha
had
seen
all
kinds
of
sights
but
here
he
felt
his
mind
becoming
obscured
as
with
a
veil
and
he
could
find
nothing
to
say
but
the
at
once
mundane
and
utterly
absurd
phrase
this
cannot
be
rimsky
acted
otherwise
he
stood
up
opened
the
door
barked
out
to
the
messenger
girl
sitting
on
a
stool
let
no
one
in
except
postmen
and
locked
the
door
with
a
key
then
he
took
a
pile
of
papers
out
of
the
desk
and
began
carefully
to
compare
the
bold
backslanting
letters
of
the
photogram
with
the
letters
in
styopa
s
resolutions
and
signatures
furnished
with
a
corkscrew
flourish
varenukha
leaning
his
weight
on
the
table
breathed
hotly
on
rimsky
s
cheek
it
s
his
handwriting
the
findirector
finally
said
firmly
and
varenukha
repeated
like
an
echo
his
peering
into
rimsky
s
face
the
administrator
marvelled
at
the
change
that
had
come
over
this
face
thin
to
begin
with
the
findirector
seemed
to
have
grown
still
thinner
and
even
older
his
eyes
in
their
horn
rims
had
lost
their
customary
prickliness
and
there
appeared
in
them
not
only
alarm
but
even
sorrow
varenukha
did
everything
that
a
man
in
a
moment
of
great
astonishment
ought
to
do
he
raced
up
and
down
the
office
he
raised
his
arms
twice
like
one
crucified
he
drank
a
whole
glass
of
yellowish
water
from
the
carafe
and
exclaimed
i
don
t
understand
i
don
t
understand
i
don
t
understand
rimsky
meanwhile
was
looking
out
the
window
thinking
hard
about
something
the
findirector
s
position
was
very
difficult
it
was
necessary
at
once
right
on
the
spot
to
invent
ordinary
explanations
for
extraordinary
phenomena
narrowing
his
eyes
the
findirector
pictured
to
himself
styopa
in
a
nightshirt
and
shoeless
getting
into
some
unprecedented
superhighspeed
airplane
at
around
half
past
eleven
that
morning
and
then
the
same
styopa
also
at
half
past
eleven
standing
in
his
stocking
feet
at
the
airport
in
yalta
devil
knew
what
to
make
of
it
maybe
it
was
not
styopa
who
talked
with
him
this
morning
over
the
phone
from
his
own
apartment
no
it
was
styopa
speaking
who
if
not
he
should
know
styopa
s
voice
and
even
if
it
was
not
styopa
speaking
today
it
was
no
earlier
than
yesterday
towards
evening
that
styopa
had
come
from
his
office
to
this
very
office
with
this
idiotic
contract
and
annoyed
the
findirector
with
his
lightmindedness
how
could
he
have
gone
or
flown
away
without
leaving
word
at
the
theatre
but
if
he
had
flown
away
yesterday
evening
he
would
not
have
arrived
by
noon
today
or
would
he
how
many
miles
is
it
to
yalta
asked
rimsky
varenukha
stopped
his
running
and
yelled
i
thought
of
that
i
already
thought
of
it
by
train
it
s
over
nine
hundred
miles
to
sebastopol
plus
another
fifty
to
yalta
well
but
by
air
of
course
it
s
less
hm
yes
there
could
be
no
question
of
any
trains
but
what
then
some
fighter
plane
who
would
let
styopa
on
any
fighter
plane
without
his
shoes
what
for
maybe
he
took
his
shoes
off
when
he
got
to
yalta
it
s
the
same
thing
what
for
and
even
with
his
shoes
on
they
wouldn
t
have
let
him
on
a
fighter
and
what
has
the
fighter
got
to
do
with
it
it
s
written
that
he
came
to
the
investigators
at
half
past
eleven
in
the
morning
and
he
talked
on
the
telephone
in
moscow
excuse
me
the
face
of
rimsky
s
watch
emerged
before
his
eyes
rimsky
tried
to
remember
where
the
hands
had
been
terrible
it
had
been
twenty
minutes
past
eleven
so
what
does
it
boil
down
to
if
one
supposes
that
after
the
conversation
styopa
instantly
rushed
to
the
airport
and
reached
it
in
say
five
minutes
which
incidentally
was
also
unthinkable
it
means
that
the
plane
taking
off
at
once
covered
nearly
a
thousand
miles
in
five
minutes
consequently
it
was
flying
at
twelve
thousand
miles
an
hour
that
cannot
be
and
that
means
he
s
not
in
yalta
what
remains
then
hypnosis
there
s
no
hypnosis
in
the
world
that
can
fling
a
man
a
thousand
miles
away
so
he
s
imagining
that
he
s
in
yalta
he
may
be
imagining
it
but
are
the
yalta
investigators
also
imagining
it
no
no
sorry
that
can
t
be
yet
they
did
telegraph
from
there
the
findirector
s
face
was
literally
dreadful
the
door
handle
was
all
the
while
being
turned
and
pulled
from
outside
and
the
messenger
girl
could
be
heard
through
the
door
crying
desperately
impossible
i
won
t
let
you
cut
me
to
pieces
it
s
a
meeting
rimsky
regained
control
of
himself
as
well
as
he
could
took
the
receiver
of
the
phone
and
said
into
it
a
superurgent
call
to
yalta
please
clever
varenukha
observed
mentally
but
the
conversation
with
yalta
did
not
take
place
rimsky
hung
up
the
receiver
and
said
as
luck
would
have
it
the
line
s
broken
it
could
be
seen
that
the
broken
line
especially
upset
him
for
some
reason
and
even
made
him
lapse
into
thought
having
thought
a
little
he
again
took
the
receiver
in
one
hand
and
with
the
other
began
writing
down
what
he
said
into
it
take
a
superlightning
variety
yes
yalta
criminal
investigation
yes
today
around
eleven
thirty
likhodeev
talked

after
that
did
not

unable

confirm

stop
taking
measures

said
artiste
findirector
rimsky
very
clever
thought
varenukha
but
before
he
had
time
to
think
well
the
words
rushed
through
his
head
stupid
he
can
t
be
in
yalta
rimsky
meanwhile
did
the
following
he
neatly
stacked
all
the
received
telegrams
plus
the
copy
of
his
own
put
the
stack
into
an
envelope
sealed
it
wrote
a
few
words
on
it
and
handed
it
to
varenukha
saying
go
right
now
ivan
savelyevich
take
it
there
personally
let
them
sort
it
out
now
that
is
really
clever
thought
varenukha
and
he
put
the
envelope
into
his
briefcase
then
just
in
case
he
dialled
styopa
s
apartment
number
on
the
telephone
listened
and
began
winking
and
grimacing
joyfully
and
mysteriously
rimsky
stretched
his
neck
may
i
speak
with
the
artiste
woland
varenukha
asked
sweetly
mister
s
busy
the
receiver
answered
in
a
rattling
voice
who
s
calling
the
administrator
of
the
variety
varenukha
ivan
savelyevich
the
receiver
cried
out
joyfully
terribly
glad
to
hear
your
voice
how
re
you
doing
merci
varenukha
replied
in
amazement
and
with
whom
am
i
speaking
his
assistant
his
assistant
and
interpreter
koroviev
crackled
the
receiver
i
m
entirely
at
your

so

the
receiver
shouted
he
left
for
where
out
of
town
for
a
drive
in
the
car
wh
what
a
dr
drive
and
when
will
he
be

he
said

a
breath
of
fresh
air
and

so
said
the
puzzled
varenukha
merci

monsieur

that
his
performance

in
the
third
part
of
the
programme
right
of

urgently
without
fail
i
ll

the
receiver
rapped
out
abruptly
goodbye
varenukha
said
in
astonishment
please
accept
said
the
receiver
my
best
warmest
greetings
and
wishes
for
success
luck
complete
happiness
everything
but
of
course
didn
t
i
say
so
the
administrator
cried
agitatedly
it
s
not
any
yalta
he
just
went
to
the
country
well
if
that
s
so
the
findirector
began
turning
pale
with
anger
it
s
real
swinishness
there
s
even
no
name
for
it
here
the
administrator
jumped
up
and
shouted
so
that
rimsky
gave
a
start
i
remember
i
remember
they
ve
opened
a
new
georgian
tavern
in
pushkino
called
yalta
it
s
all
clear
he
went
there
got
drunk
and
now
he
s
sending
telegrams
from
there
well
now
that
s
too
much
rimsky
answered
his
cheek
twitching
and
deep
genuine
anger
burned
in
his
eyes
well
then
he
s
going
to
pay
dearly
for
this
little
excursion
he
suddenly
faltered
and
added
irresolutely
but
what
about
the
criminal
investlgation
it
s
nonsense
his
own
little
jokes
the
expansive
administrator
interrupted
and
asked
shall
i
take
the
envelope
absolutely
replied
rimsky
and
again
the
door
opened
and
in
came
that
same
her
thought
rimsky
for
some
reason
with
anguish
and
both
men
rose
to
meet
the
postwoman
this
time
the
telegram
contained
the
words
thank
you
confirmation
send
five
hundred
urgently
criminal
investigation
my
name
tomorrow
fly
moscow
likhodeev
he
s
lost
his
mind
varenukha
said
weakly
rimsky
jingled
his
key
took
money
from
the
fireproof
safe
counted
out
five
hundred
roubles
rang
the
bell
handed
the
messenger
the
money
and
sent
him
to
the
telegraph
office
good
heavens
grigory
danilovich
varenukha
said
not
believing
his
eyes
in
my
opinion
you
oughtn
t
to
send
the
money
it
ll
come
back
rimsky
replied
quietly
but
he
ll
have
a
hard
time
explaining
this
little
picnic
and
he
added
indicating
the
briefcase
to
varenukha
go
ivan
savelyevich
don
t
delay
and
varenukha
ran
out
of
the
office
with
the
briefcase
he
went
down
to
the
ground
floor
saw
the
longest
line
at
the
box
office
found
out
from
the
boxoffice
girl
that
she
expected
to
sell
out
within
the
hour
because
the
public
was
simply
pouring
in
since
the
additional
poster
had
been
put
up
told
the
girl
to
earmark
and
hold
thirty
of
the
best
seats
in
the
gallery
and
the
stalls
popped
out
of
the
box
office
shook
off
importunate
passseekers
as
he
ran
and
dived
into
his
little
office
to
get
his
cap
at
that
moment
the
telephone
rattled
yes
varenukha
shouted
ivan
savelyevich
the
receiver
inquired
in
a
most
repulsive
nasal
voice
he
s
not
in
the
theatre
varenukha
was
shouting
but
the
receiver
interrupted
him
at
once
don
t
play
the
fool
ivan
savelyevich
just
listen
do
not
take
those
telegrams
anywhere
or
show
them
to
anyone
who
is
this
varenukha
bellowed
stop
these
jokes
citizen
you
ll
be
found
out
at
once
what
s
your
number
varenukha
the
same
nasty
voice
returned
do
you
understand
russian
don
t
take
the
telegrams
anywhere
ah
so
you
won
t
stop
the
administrator
cried
furiously
look
out
then
you
re
going
to
pay
for
it
he
shouted
some
other
threat
but
fell
silent
because
he
sensed
that
no
one
was
listening
to
him
any
longer
in
the
receiver
here
it
somehow
began
to
grow
dark
very
quickly
in
his
little
office
varenukha
ran
out
slammed
the
door
behind
him
and
rushed
through
the
side
entrance
into
the
summer
garden
the
administrator
was
agitated
and
full
of
energy
after
the
insolent
phone
call
he
had
no
doubts
that
it
was
a
band
of
hooligans
playing
nasty
tricks
and
that
these
tricks
were
connected
with
the
disappearance
of
likhodeev
the
administrator
was
choking
with
the
desire
to
expose
the
malefactors
and
strange
as
it
was
the
anticipation
of
something
enjoyable
was
born
in
him
it
happens
that
way
when
a
man
strives
to
become
the
centre
of
attention
to
bring
sensational
news
somewhere
in
the
garden
the
wind
blew
in
the
administrator
s
face
and
flung
sand
in
his
eyes
as
if
blocking
his
way
as
if
cautioning
him
a
window
on
the
second
floor
slammed
so
that
the
glass
nearly
broke
the
tops
of
the
maples
and
lindens
rustled
alarmingly
it
became
darker
and
colder
the
administrator
rubbed
his
eyes
and
saw
that
a
yellowbellied
storm
cloud
was
creeping
low
over
moscow
there
came
a
dense
distant
rumbling
however
great
varenukha
s
hurry
an
irrepressible
desire
pulled
at
him
to
run
over
to
the
summer
toilet
for
a
second
on
his
way
to
check
whether
the
repairman
had
put
a
wire
screen
over
the
lightbulb
running
past
the
shooting
gallery
varenukha
came
to
a
thick
growth
of
lilacs
where
the
lightblue

stood
the
repairman
turned
out
to
be
an
efficient
fellow
the
bulb
under
the
roof
of
the
gentlemen
s
side
was
covered
with
a
wire
screen
but
the
administrator
was
upset
that
even
in
the
prestorm
darkness
one
could
make
out
that
the
walls
were
already
written
all
over
in
charcoal
and
pencil
well
what
sort
of
the
administrator
began
and
suddenly
heard
a
voice
purring
behind
him
is
that
you
ivan
savelyevich
varenukha
started
turned
around
and
saw
before
him
a
short
fat
man
with
what
seemed
to
him
a
catlike
physiognomy
so
it
s
me
varenukha
answered
hostilely
very
very
glad
the
catlike
fat
man
responded
in
a
squeaky
voice
and
suddenly
swinging
his
arm
gave
varenukha
such
a
blow
on
the
ear
that
the
cap
flew
off
the
administrator
s
head
and
vanished
without
a
trace
down
the
hole
in
the
seat
at
the
fat
man
s
blow
the
whole
toilet
lit
up
momentarily
with
a
tremulous
light
and
a
roll
of
thunder
echoed
in
the
sky
then
came
another
flash
and
a
second
man
emerged
before
the
administrator
short
but
with
athletic
shoulders
hair
red
as
fire
albugo
in
one
eye
a
fang
in
his
mouth
this
second
one
evidently
a
lefty
socked
the
administrator
on
the
other
ear
in
response
there
was
another
roll
of
thunder
in
the
sky
and
rain
poured
down
on
the
wooden
roof
of
the
toilet
what
is
it
comr
the
halfcrazed
administrator
whispered
realized
at
once
that
the
word
comrades
hardly
fitted
bandits
attacking
a
man
in
a
public
toilet
rasped
out
citiz
figured
that
they
did
not
merit
this
appellation
either
and
received
a
third
terrible
blow
from
he
did
not
know
which
of
them
so
that
blood
gushed
from
his
nose
on
to
his
tolstoy
blouse
what
you
got
in
the
briefcase
parasite
the
one
resembling
a
cat
cried
shrilly

not
to
take
them
anywhere
weren

asking
you

the

answered
suffocating
and
you
skipped
off
anyway

the
second
one
cried
in
the
same
nasal
voice
that
had
come
over
the
telephone
and
he
yanked
the
briefcase
from
varenukha
s
trembling
hands
and
the
two
picked
the
administrator
up
under
the
arms
dragged
him
out
of
the
garden
and
raced
down
sadovaya
with
him
the
storm
raged
at
full
force
water
streamed
with
a
noise
and
howling
down
the
drains
waves
bubbled
and
billowed
everywhere
water
gushed
from
the
roofs
past
the
drainpipes
foamy
streams
ran
from

everything
living
got
washed
off

and
there
was
no
one
to
save
ivan
savelyevich
leaping
through
muddy
rivers
under
flashes
of
lightning
the
bandits
dragged
the
halfalive
administrator
in
a
split
second
to
no
bis
flew
with
him
through
the
gateway
where
two
barefoot
women
holding
their
shoes
and
stockings
in
their
hands
pressed
themselves
to
the
wall
then
they
dashed
into
the
sixth
entrance
and
varenukha
nearly
insane
was
taken
up
to
the
fifth
floor
and
thrown
down
in
the
semidark
front
hall
so
well
known
to
him
of
styopa
likhodeev
s
apartment
here
the
two
robbers
vanished
and
in
their
place
there
appeared
in
the
front
hall
a
completely
naked
girl
redhaired
her
eyes
burning
with
a
phosphorescent
gleam
varenukha
understood
that
this
was
the
most
terrible
of
all
things
that
had
ever
happened
to
him
and
moaning
recoiled
against
the
wall
but
the
girl
came
right
up
to
the
administrator
and
placed
the
palms
of
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
varenukha
s
hair
stood
on
end
because
even
through
the
cold
watersoaked
cloth
of
his
tolstoy
blouse
he
could
feel
that
those
palms
were
still
colder
that
their
cold
was
the
cold
of
ice
let
me
give
you
a
kiss
the
girl
said
tenderly
and
there
were
shining
eyes
right
in
front
of
his
eyes
then
varenukha
fainted
and
never
felt
the
kiss

ivan
splits
in
two
the
woods
on
the
opposite
bank
of
the
river
still
lit
up
by
the
may
sun
an
hour
earlier
turned
dull
smeary
and
dissolved
water
fell
down
in
a
solid
sheet
outside
the
window
in
the
sky
threads
flashed
every
moment
the
sky
kept
bursting

and
the
patient
s
room
was
flooded
with
a
tremulous
frightening
light
ivan
quietly
wept
sitting
on
his
bed
and
looking
out
at
the
muddy
river
boiling
with
bubbles
at
every
clap
of
thunder
he
cried
out
pitifully
and
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
pages
covered
with
ivan
s
writing
lay
about
on
the
floor
they
had
been
blown
down
by
the
wind
that
flew
into
the
room
before
the
storm
began
the
poet
s
attempts
to
write
a
statement
concerning
the
terrible
consultant
had
gone
nowhere
as
soon
as
he
got
the
pencil
stub
and
paper
from
the
fat
attendant
whose
name
was
praskovya
fyodorovna
he
rubbed
his
hands
in
a
businesslike
way
and
hastily
settled
himself
at
the
little
table
the
beginning
came
out
quite
glibly
to
the
police
from
massolit
member
ivan
nikolaevich
homeless
a
statement
yesterday
evening
i
came
to
the
patriarch
s
ponds
with
the
deceased
m
a
berlioz
and
right
there
the
poet
got
confused
mainly
owing
to
the
word
deceased
some
nonsensicality
emerged
at
once
what
s
this
came
with
the
deceased
the
deceased
don
t
go
anywhere
really
for
all
he
knew
they
might
take
him
for
a
madman
having
reflected
thus
ivan
nikolaevich
began
to
correct
what
he
had
written
what
came
out
this
time
was
with
m
a
berlioz
subsequently
deceased
this
did
not
satisfy
the
author
either
he
had
to
have
recourse
to
a
third
redaction
which
proved
still
worse
than
the
first
two
berlioz
who
fell
under
the
tramcar
and
that
namesake
composer
unknown
to
anyone
was
also
dangling
here
so
he
had
to
put
in
not
the
composer
after
suffering
over
these
two
berliozes
ivan
crossed
it
all
out
and
decided
to
begin
right
off
with
something
very
strong
in
order
to
attract
the
reader
s
attention
at
once
so
he
wrote
that
a
cat
had
got
on
a
tramcar
and
then
went
back
to
the
episode
with
the
severed
head
the
head
and
the
consultant
s
prediction
led
him
to
the
thought
of
pontius
pilate
and
for
greater
conviction
ivan
decided
to
tell
the
whole
story
of
the
procurator
in
full
from
the
moment
he
walked
out
in
his
white
cloak
with
bloodred
lining
to
the
colonnade
of
herod
s
palace
ivan
worked
assiduously
crossing
out
what
he
had
written
putting
in
new
words
and
even
attempted
to
draw
pontius
pilate
and
then
a
cat
standing
on
its
hind
legs
but
the
drawings
did
not
help
and
the
further
it
went
the
more
confusing
and
incomprehensible
the
poet
s
statement
became
by
the
time
the
frightening
cloud
with
smoking
edges
appeared
from
far
off
and
covered
the
woods
and
the
wind
began
to
blow
ivan
felt
that
he
was
strengthless
that
he
would
never
be
able
to
manage
with
the
statement
and
he
would
not
pick
up
the
scattered
pages
and
he
wept
quietly
and
bitterly
the
goodnatured
nurse
praskovya
fyodorovna
visited
the
poet
during
the
storm
became
alarmed
on
seeing
him
weeping
closed
the
blinds
so
that
the
lightning
would
not
frighten
the
patient
picked
up
the
pages
from
the
floor
and
ran
with
them
for
the
doctor
he
came
gave
ivan
an
injection
in
the
arm
and
assured
him
that
he
would
not
weep
any
more
that
everything
would
pass
now
everything
would
change
everything
would
be
forgotten
the
doctor
proved
right
soon
the
woods
across
the
river
became
as
before
it
was
outlined
to
the
last
tree
under
the
sky
which
cleared
to
its
former
perfect
blue
and
the
river
grew
calm
anguish
had
begun
to
leave
ivan
right
after
the
injection
and
now
the
poet
lay
calmly
and
looked
at
the
rainbow
that
stretched
across
the
sky
so
it
went
till
evening
and
he
did
not
even
notice
how
the
rainbow
melted
away
how
the
sky
saddened
and
faded
how
the
woods
turned
black
having
drunk
some
hot
milk
ivan
lay
down
again
and
marvelled
himself
at
how
changed
his
thinking
was
the
accursed
demonic
cat
somehow
softened
in
his
memory
the
severed
head
did
not
frighten
him
any
more
and
abandoning
all
thought
of
it
ivan
began
to
reflect
that
essentially
it
was
not
so
bad
in
the
clinic
that
stravinsky
was
a
clever
man
and
a
famous
one
and
it
was
quite
pleasant
to
deal
with
him
besides
the
evening
air
was
sweet
and
fresh
after
the
storm
the
house
of
sorrow
was
falling
asleep
in
quiet
corridors
the
frosted
white
lights
went
out
and
in
their
place
according
to
regulations
faint
blue
nightlights
were
lit
and
the
careful
steps
of
attendants
were
heard
more
and
more
rarely
on
the
rubber
matting
of
the
corridor
outside
the
door
now
ivan
lay
in
sweet
languor
glancing
at
the
lamp
under
its
shade
shedding
a
softened
light
from
the
ceiling
then
at
the
moon
rising
behind
the
black
woods
and
conversed
with
himself
why
actually
did
i
get
so
excited
about
berlioz
falling
under
a
tramcar
the
poet
reasoned
in
the
final
analysis
let
him
sink
what
am
i
in
fact
his
chum
or
inlaw
if
we
air
the
question
properly
it
turns
out
that
in
essence
i
really
did
not
even
know
the
deceased
what
indeeddid
i
know
about
him
nothing
except
that
he
was
bald
and
terribly
eloquent
and
furthermore
citizens
ivan
continued
his
speech
addressing
someone
or
other
let
s
sort
this
out
why
tell
me
did
i
get
furious
at
this
mysterious
consultant
magician
and
professor
with
the
black
and
emptyeye
why
all
this
absurd
chase
after
him
in
underpants
and
with
a
candle
in
my
hand
and
then
those
wild
shenanigans
in
the
restaurant
uhuhuh
the
former
ivan
suddenly
said
sternly
somewhere
either
inside
or
over
his
ear
to
the
new
ivan
he
did
know
beforehand
that
berlioz
s
head
would
be
cut
off
didn
t
he
how
could
i
not
get
excited
what
are
we
talking
about
comrades
the
new
ivan
objected
to
the
old
former
ivan
that
things
are
not
quite
proper
here
even
a
child
can
understand
he
s
a
onehundredpercent
outstanding
and
mysterious
person
but
that
s
the
most
interesting
thing
the
man
was
personally
acquainted
with
pontius
pilate
what
could
be
more
interesting
than
that
and
instead
of
raising
a
stupid
rumpus
at
the
ponds
wouldn
t
it
have
been
more
intelligent
to
question
him
politely
about
what
happened
further
on
with
pilate
and
his
prisoner
hanozri
and
i
started
devil
knows
what
a
major
occurrence
really
a
magazine
editor
gets
run
over
and
so
what
is
the
magazine
going
to
shut
down
for
that
well
what
can
be
done
about
it
man
is
mortal
and
as
has
rightly
been
said
unexpectedly
mortal
well
may
he
rest
in
peace
well
so
there
ll
be
another
editor
and
maybe
even
more
eloquent
than
the
previous
one
after
dozing
for
a
while
the
new
ivan
asked
the
old
ivan
sarcastically
and
what
does
it
make
me
in
that
case
a
fool
a
bass
voice
said
distinctly
somewhere
a
voice
not
belonging
to
either
of
the
ivans
and
extremely
like
the
bass
of
the
consultant
ivan
for
some
reason
not
offended
by
the
word
fool
but
even
pleasantly
surprised
at
it
smiled
and
drowsily
grew
quiet
sleep
was
stealing
over
ivan
and
he
was
already
picturing
a
palm
tree
on
its
elephant
s
leg
and
a
cat
passing
by
not
scary
but
merry
and
in
short
sleep
was
just
about
to
come
over
ivan
when
the
grille
suddenly
moved
noiselessly
aside
and
a
mysterious
figure
appeared
on
the
balcony
hiding
from
the
moonlight
and
shook
its
finger
at
ivan
not
frightened
in
the
least
ivan
sat
up
in
bed
and
saw
that
there
was
a
man
on
the
balcony
and
this
man
pressing
a
finger
to
his
lips
whispered
shhh
chapter
black
magic
and
its
exposure
a
small
man
in
a
yellow
bowlerhat
full
of
holes
and
with
a
pearshaped
raspberrycoloured
nose
in
checkered
trousers
and
patentleather
shoes
rolled
out
on
to
the
stage
of
the
variety
on
an
ordinary
twowheeled
bicycle
to
the
sounds
of
a
foxtrot
he
made
a
circle
and
then
gave
a
triumphant
shout
which
caused
his
bicycle
to
rear
up
after
riding
around
on
the
back
wheel
the
little
man
turned
upside
down
contrived
while
in
motion
to
unscrew
the
front
wheel
and
send
it
backstage
and
then
proceeded
on
his
way
with
one
wheel
turning
the
pedals
with
his
hands
on
a
tall
metal
pole
with
a
seat
at
the
top
and
a
single
wheel
a
plump
blonde
rolled
out
in
tights
and
a
little
skirt
strewn
with
silver
stars
and
began
riding
in
a
circle
as
he
met
her
the
little
man
uttered
cries
of
greeting
doffing
his
bowlerhat
with
his
foot
finally
a
little
eightyearold
with
an
elderly
face
came
rolling
out
and
began
scooting
about
among
the
adults
on
a
tiny
twowheeler
furnished
with
an
enormous
automobile
horn
after
making
several
loops
the
whole
company
to
the
alarming
drumbeats
of
the
orchestra
rolled
to
the
very
edge
of
the
stage
and
the
spectators
in
the
front
rows
gasped
and
drew
back
because
it
seemed
to
the
public
that
the
whole
trio
with
its
vehicles
was
about
to
crash
down
into
the
orchestra
pit
but
the
bicycles
stopped
just
at
the
moment
when
the
front
wheels
threatened
to
slide
into
the
abyss
on
the
heads
of
the
musicians
with
a
loud
shout
of
hup
the
cyclists
jumped
off
their
vehicles
and
bowed
the
blonde
woman
blowing
kisses
to
the
public
and
the
little
one
tooting
a
funny
signal
on
his
horn
applause
shook
the
building
the
lightblue
curtain
came
from
both
sides
and
covered
the
cyclists
the
green
exit
lights
by
the
doors
went
out
and
in
the
web
of
trapezes
under
the
cupola
white
spheres
lit
up
like
the
sun
it
was
the
intermission
before
the
last
part
the
only
man
who
was
not
the
least
bit
interested
in
the
wonders
of
the
giulli
family
s
cycling
technique
was
grigory
danilovich
rimsky
in
complete
solitude
he
sat
in
his
office
biting
his
thin
lips
a
spasm
passing
over
his
face
from
time
to
time
to
the
extraordinary
disappearance
of
likhodeev
had
now
been
added
the
wholly
unforeseen
disappearance
of
varenukha
rimsky
knew
where
he
had
gone
but
he
had
gone
and
not
come
back
rimsky
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
whispered
to
himself
but
what
for
and
it
was
strange
for
such
a
practical
man
as
the
findirector
the
simplest
thing
would
of
course
have
been
to
call
the
place
where
varenukha
had
gone
and
find
out
what
had
befallen
him
yet
until
ten
o
clock
at
night
he
had
been
unable
to
force
himself
to
do
it
at
ten
doing
outright
violence
to
himself
rimsky
picked
up
the
receiver
and
here
discovered
that
his
telephone
was
dead
the
messenger
reported
that
the
other
telephones
in
the
building
were
also
out
of
order
this
certainly
unpleasant
though
hardly
supernatural
occurrence
for
some
reason
thoroughly
shocked
the
findirector
but
at
the
same
time
he
was
glad
the
need
to
call
fell
away
just
as
the
red
light
over
the
findirector
s
head
lit
up
and
blinked
announcing
the
beginning
of
the
intermission
a
messenger
came
in
and
informed
him
of
the
foreign
artiste
s
arrival
the
findirector
cringed
for
some
reason
and
blacker
than
a
storm
cloud
went
backstage
to
receive
the
visitor
since
there
was
no
one
else
to
receive
him
under
various
pretexts
curious
people
kept
peeking
into
the
big
dressing
room
from
the
corridor
where
the
signal
bell
was
already
ringing
among
them
were
conjurers
in
bright
robes
and
turbans
a
skater
in
a
white
knitted
jacket
a
storyteller
pale
with
powder
and
the
makeup
man
the
newly
arrived
celebrity
struck
everyone
by
his
marvellously
cut
tailcoat
of
a
length
never
seen
before
and
by
his
having
come
in
a
black
halfmask
but
most
remarkable
of
all
were
the
black
magician
s
two
companions
a
long
checkered
one
with
a
cracked
pincenez
and
a
fat
black
cat
who
came
into
the
dressing
room
on
his
hind
legs
and
quite
nonchalantly
sat
on
the
sofa
squinting
at
the
bare
makeup
lights
rimsky
attempted
to
produce
a
smile
on
his
face
which
made
it
look
sour
and
spiteful
and
bowed
to
the
silent
black
magician
who
was
seated
on
the
sofa
beside
the
cat
there
was
no
handshake
instead
the
easygoing
checkered
one
made
his
own
introductions
to
the
findirector
calling
himself
the
gent
s
assistant
this
circumstance
surprised
the
findirector
and
unpleasantly
so
there
was
decidedly
no
mention
of
any
assistant
in
the
contract
quite
stiffly
and
drily
grigory
danilovich
inquired
of
this
fallenfromthesky
checkered
one
where
the
artiste
s
paraphernalia
was
our
heavenly
diamond
most
precious
mister
director
the
magician
s
assistant
replied
in
a
rattling
voice
the
paraphernalia
is
always
with
us
here
it
is
ein
zwei
drei
and
waving
his
knotty
fingers
before
rimsky
s
eyes
he
suddenly
took
from
behind
the
cat
s
ear
rimsky
s
own
gold
watch
and
chain
hitherto
worn
by
the
findirector
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
under
his
buttoned
coat
with
the
chain
through
a
buttonhole
rimsky
inadvertently
clutched
his
stomach
those
present
gasped
and
the
makeup
man
peeking
in
the
doorway
grunted
approvingly
your
little
watchie
kindly
take
it
the
checkered
one
said
smiling
casually
and
offering
the
bewildered
rimsky
his
own
property
on
a
dirty
palm
no
getting
on
a
tram
with
that
one
the
storyteller
whispered
quietly
and
merrily
to
the
makeup
man
but
the
cat
pulled
a
neater
trick
than
the
number
with
the
stolen
watch
getting
up
from
the
sofa
unexpectedly
he
walked
on
his
hind
legs
to
the
dressing
table
pulled
the
stopper
out
of
the
carafe
with
his
front
paw
poured
water
into
a
glass
drank
it
installed
the
stopper
in
its
place
and
wiped
his
whiskers
with
a
makeup
cloth
here
no
one
even
gasped
their
mouths
simply
fell
open
and
the
makeup
man
whispered
admiringly
that
s
class
just
then
the
bells
rang
alarmingly
for
the
third
time
and
everyone
agitated
and
anticipating
an
interesting
number
thronged
out
of
the
dressing
room
a
moment
later
the
spheres
went
out
in
the
theatre
the
footlights
blazed
up
lending
a
reddish
glow
to
the
base
of
the
curtain
and
in
the
lighted
gap
of
the
curtain
there
appeared
before
the
public
a
plump
man
merry
as
a
baby
with
a
cleanshaven
face
in
a
rumpled
tailcoat
and
nonetoofresh
shirt
this
was
the
master
of
ceremonies
well
known
to
all
moscow
georges
bengalsky
and
now
citizens
bengalsky
began
smiling
his
baby
smile
there
is
about
to
come
before
you
here
bengalsky
interrupted
himself
and
spoke
in
a
different
tone
i
see
the
audience
has
grown
for
the
third
part
we
ve
got
half
the
city
here
i
met
a
friend
the
other
day
and
said
to
him
why
don
t
you
come
to
our
show
yesterday
we
had
half
the
city
and
he
says
to
me
i
live
in
the
other
half
bengalsky
paused
waiting
for
a
burst
of
laughter
but
as
no
one
laughed
he
went
on
and
so
now
comes
the
famous
foreign
artiste
monsieur
woland
with
a
seance
of
black
magic
well
both
you
and
i
know
here
bengalsky
smiled
a
wise
smile
that
there
s
no
such
thing
in
the
world
and
that
it
s
all
just
superstition
and
maestro
woland
is
simply
a
perfect
master
of
the
technique
of
conjuring
as
we
shall
see
from
the
most
interesting
part
thatis
the
exposure
of
this
technique
and
since
we
re
all
of
us
to
a
man
both
for
technique
and
for
its
exposure
let
s
bring
on
mr
woland
after
uttering
all
this
claptrap
bengalsky
pressed
his
palms
together
and
waved
them
in
greeting
through
the
slit
of
the
curtain
which
caused
it
to
part
with
a
soft
rustle
the
entrance
of
the
magician
with
his
long
assistant
and
the
cat
who
came
on
stage
on
his
hind
legs
pleased
the
audience
greatly
an
armchair
for
me
woland
ordered
in
a
low
voice
and
that
same
second
an
armchair
appeared
on
stage
no
one
knew
how
or
from
where
in
which
the
magician
sat
down
tell
me
my
gentle
fagott
woland
inquired
of
the
checkered
clown
who
evidently
had
another
appellation
than
koroviev
what
do
you
think
the
moscow
populace
has
changed
significantly
hasn
t
it
the
magician
looked
out
at
the
hushed
audience
struck
by
the
appearance
of
the
armchair
out
of
nowhere
that
it
has
messire
fagottkoroviev
replied
in
a
low
voice
you
re
right
the
city
folk
have
changed
greatly
externally
that
is
as
has
the
city
itself
incidentally
not
to
mention
their
clothing
these
what
do
you
call
them
trams
automobiles
have
appeared
buses
fagott
prompted
deferentially
the
audience
listened
attentively
to
this
conversation
thinking
it
constituted
a
prelude
to
the
magic
tricks
the
wings
were
packed
with
performers
and
stagehands
and
among
their
faces
could
be
seen
the
tense
pale
face
of
rimsky
the
physiognomy
of
bengalsky
who
had
retreated
to
the
side
of
the
stage
began
to
show
some
perplexity
he
raised
one
eyebrow
slightly
and
taking
advantage
of
a
pause
spoke
the
foreign
artiste
is
expressing
his
admiration
for
moscow
and
its
technological
development
as
well
as
for
the
muscovites
here
bengalsky
smiled
twice
first
to
the
stalls
then
to
the
gallery
woland
fagott
and
the
cat
turned
their
heads
in
the
direction
of
the
master
of
ceremonies
did
i
express
admiration
the
magician
asked
the
checkered
fagott
by
no
means
messire
you
never
expressed
any
admiration
came
the
reply
then
what
is
the
man
saying
he
quite
simply
lied
the
checkered
assistant
declared
sonorously
for
the
whole
theatre
to
hear
and
turning
to
bengalsky
he
added
congrats
citizen
you
done
lied
tittering
spattered
from
the
gallery
but
bengalsky
gave
a
start
and
goggled
his
eyes
of
course
i
m
not
so
much
interested
in
buses
telephones
and
other
apparatuses
the
checkered
one
prompted
quite
right
thank
you
the
magician
spoke
slowly
in
a
heavy
bass
as
in
a
question
of
much
greater
importance
have
the
city
folk
changed
inwardly
yes
that
is
the
most
important
question
sir
there
was
shrugging
and
an
exchanging
of
glances
in
the
wings
bengalsky
stood
all
red
and
rimsky
was
pale
but
here
as
if
sensing
the
nascent
alarm
the
magician
said
however
we
re
talking
away
my
dear
fagott
and
the
audience
is
beginning
to
get
bored
my
gentle
fagott
show
us
some
simple
little
thing
to
start
with
the
audience
stirred
fagott
and
the
cat
walked
along
the
footlights
to
opposite
sides
of
the
stage
fagott
snapped
his
fingers
and
with
a
rollicking
three
four
snatched
a
deck
of
cards
from
the
air
shuffled
it
and
sent
it
in
a
long
ribbon
to
the
cat
the
cat
intercepted
it
and
sent
it
back
the
satiny
snake
whiffled
fagott
opened
his
mouth
like
a
nestling
and
swallowed
it
all
card
by
card
after
which
the
cat
bowed
scraping
his
right
hind
paw
winning
himself
unbelievable
applause
class
real
class
rapturous
shouts
came
from
the
wings
and
fagott
jabbed
his
finger
at
the
stalls
and
announced
you
ll
find
that
same
deck
esteemed
citizens
on
citizen
parchevsky
in
the
seventh
row
just
between
a
threerouble
bill
and
a
summons
to
court
in
connection
with
the
payment
of
alimony
to
citizen
zelkova
there
was
a
stirring
in
the
stalls
people
began
to
get
up
and
finally
some
citizen
whose
name
was
indeed
parchevsky
all
crimson
with
amazement
extracted
the
deck
from
his
wallet
and
began
sticking
it
up
in
the
air
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
it
you
may
keep
it
as
a
souvenir
cried
fagott
not
for
nothing
did
you
say
at
dinner
yesterday
that
if
it
weren
t
for
poker
your
life
in
moscow
would
be
utterly
unbearable
an
old
trick
came
from
the
gallery
the
one
in
the
stalls
is
from
the
same
company
you
think
so
shouted
fagott
squinting
at
the
gallery
in
that
case
you
re
also
one
of
us
because
the
deck
is
now
in
your
pocket
there
was
movement
in
the
balcony
and
a
joyful
voice
said
right
he
s
got
it
here
here
wait
it
s
tenrouble
bills
those
sitting
in
the
stalls
turned
their
heads
in
the
gallery
a
bewildered
citizen
found
in
his
pocket
a
bankwrapped
packet
with
one
thousand
roubles
written
on
it
his
neighbours
hovered
over
him
and
he
in
amazement
picked
at
the
wrapper
with
his
fingernail
trying
to
find
out
if
the
bills
were
real
or
some
sort
of
magic
ones
by
god
they
re
real
tenrouble
bills
joyful
cries
came
from
the
gallery
i
want
to
play
with
the
same
kind
of
deck
a
fat
man
in
the
middle
of
the
stalls
requested
merrily
avec
playzeer
fagott
responded
but
why
just
you
everyone
will
warmly
participate
and
he
commanded
look
up
please
one
there
was
a
pistol
in
his
hand
he
shouted
two
the
pistol
was
pointed
up
he
shouted
three
there
was
a
flash
a
bang
and
all
at
once
from
under
the
cupola
bobbing
between
the
trapezes
white
strips
of
paper
began
falling
into
the
theatre
they
twirled
got
blown
aside
were
drawn
towards
the
gallery
bounced
into
the
orchestra
and
on
to
the
stage
in
a
few
seconds
the
rain
of
money
ever
thickening
reached
the
seats
and
the
spectators
began
snatching
at
it
hundreds
of
arms
were
raised
the
spectators
held
the
bills
up
to
the
lighted
stage
and
saw
the
most
true
and
honesttogod
watermarks
the
smell
also
left
no
doubts
it
was
the
incomparably
delightful
smell
of
freshly
printed
money
the
whole
theatre
was
seized
first
with
merriment
and
then
with
amazement
the
word
money
money
hummed
everywhere
there
were
gasps
of
ah
ah
and
merry
laughter
one
or
two
were
already
crawling
in
the
aisles
feeling
under
the
chairs
many
stood
on
the
seats
trying
to
catch
the
flighty
capricious
notes
bewilderment
was
gradually
coming
to
the
faces
of
the
policemen
and
performers
unceremoniously
began
sticking
their
heads
out
from
the
wings
in
the
dress
circle
a
voice
was
heard
what
re
you
grabbing
at
it
s
mine
it
flew
to
me
and
another
voice
don
t
shove
me
or
you
ll
get
shoved
back
and
suddenly
there
came
the
sound
of
a
whack
at
once
a
policeman
s
helmet
appeared
in
the
dress
circle
and
someone
from
the
dress
circle
was
led
away
the
general
agitation
was
increasing
and
no
one
knows
where
it
all
would
have
ended
if
fagott
had
not
stopped
the
rain
of
money
by
suddenly
blowing
into
the
air
two
young
men
exchanging
significant
and
merry
glances
took
off
from
their
seats
and
made
straight
for
the
buffet
there
was
a
hum
in
the
theatre
all
the
spectators
eyes
glittered
excitedly
yes
yes
no
one
knows
where
it
all
would
have
ended
if
bengalsky
had
not
summoned
his
strength
and
acted
trying
to
gain
better
control
of
himself
he
rubbed
his
hands
as
was
his
custom
and
in
his
most
resounding
voice
spoke
thus
here
citizens
you
and
i
have
just
beheld
a
case
of
socalled
mass
hypnosis
a
purely
scientific
experiment
proving
in
the
best
way
possible
that
there
are
no
miracles
in
magic
let
us
ask
maestro
woland
to
expose
this
experiment
for
us
presently
citizens
you
will
see
these
supposed
banknotes
disappear
as
suddenly
as
they
appeared
here
he
applauded
but
quite
alone
while
a
confident
smile
played
on
his
face
yet
in
his
eyes
there
was
no
such
confidence
but
rather
an
expression
of
entreaty
the
audience
did
not
like
bengalsky
s
speech
total
silence
fell
which
was
broken
by
the
checkered
fagott
and
this
is
a
case
of
socalled
lying
he
announced
in
a
loud
goatish
tenor
the
notes
citizens
are
genuine
bravo
a
bass
barked
from
somewhere
on
high
this
one
incidentally
here
fagott
pointed
to
bengalsky
annoys
me
keeps
poking
his
nose
where
nobody
s
asked
him
spoils
the
seance
with
false
observations
what
re
we
going
to
do
with
him
tear
his
head
off
someone
up
in
the
gallery
said
severely
what
s
that
you
said
eh
fagott
responded
at
once
to
this
outrageous
suggestion
tear
his
head
off
there
s
an
idea
behemoth
he
shouted
to
the
cat
go
to
it
ein
zwei
drei
and
an
unheardof
thing
occurred
the
fur
bristled
on
the
cat
s
back
and
he
gave
a
rending
miaow
then
he
compressed
himself
into
a
ball
and
shot
like
a
panther
straight
at
bengalsky
s
chest
and
from
there
on
to
his
head
growling
the
cat
sank
his
plump
paws
into
the
skimpy
chevelure
of
the
master
of
ceremonies
and
in
two
twists
tore
the
head
from
thethick
neck
with
a
savage
howl
the
two
and
a
half
thousand
people
in
the
theatre
cried
out
as
one
blood
spurted
in
fountains
from
the
torn
neck
arteries
and
poured
over
the
shirtfront
and
tailcoat
the
headless
body
paddled
its
feet
somehow
absurdly
and
sat
down
on
the
floor
hysterical
women
s
cries
came
from
the
audience
the
cat
handed
the
head
to
fagott
who
lifted
it
up
by
the
hair
and
showed
it
to
the
audience
and
the
head
cried
desperately
for
all
the
theatre
to
hear
a
doctor
will
you
pour
out
such
drivel
in
the
future
fagott
asked
the
weeping
head
menacingly
never
again
croaked
the
head
for
god
s
sake
don
t
torture
him
a
woman
s
voice
from
a
box
seat
suddenly
rose
above
the
clamour
and
the
magician
turned
in
the
direction
of
that
voice
so
what
then
citizens
shall
we
forgive
him
fagott
asked
addressing
the
audience
forgive
him
forgive
him
separate
voices
mostly
women
s
spoke
first
then
merged
into
one
chorus
with
the
men
s
what
are
your
orders
messire
fagott
asked
the
masked
man
well
now
the
latter
replied
pensively
they
re
people
like
any
other
people
they
love
money
but
that
has
always
been
so
mankind
loves
money
whatever
it
s
made
of
leather
paper
bronze
gold
well
they
re
lightminded
well
what
of
it
mercy
sometimes
knocks
at
their
hearts
ordinary
people
in
general
reminiscent
of
the
former
ones
only
the
housing
problem
has
corrupted
them
and
he
ordered
loudly
tut
the
head
on
the
cat
aiming
accurately
planted
the
head
on
the
neck
and
it
sat
exactly
in
its
place
as
if
it
had
never
gone
anywhere
above
all
there
was
not
even
any
scar
left
on
the
neck
the
cat
brushed
bengalsky
s
tailcoat
and
shirtfront
with
his
paws
and
all
traces
of
blood
disappeared
from
them
fagott
got
the
sitting
bengalsky
to
his
feet
stuck
a
packet
of
money
into
his
coat
pocket
and
sent
him
from
the
stage
with
the
words
buzz
off
it
s
more
fun
without
you
staggering
and
looking
around
senselessly
the
master
of
ceremonies
had
plodded
no
farther
than
the
fire
post
when
he
felt
sick
he
cried
out
pitifully
my
head
my
head
among
those
who
rushed
to
him
was
rimsky
the
master
of
ceremonies
wept
snatched
at
something
in
the
air
with
his
hands
and
muttered
give
me
my
head
give
me
back
my
head
take
my
apartment
take
my
paintings
only
give
me
back
my
head
a
messenger
ran
for
a
doctor
they
tried
to
lie
bengalsky
down
on
a
sofa
in
the
dressing
room
but
he
began
to
struggle
became
violent
they
had
to
call
an
ambulance
when
the
unfortunate
master
of
ceremonies
was
taken
away
rimsky
ran
back
to
the
stage
and
saw
that
new
wonders
were
taking
place
on
it
ah
yes
incidentally
either
then
or
a
little
earlier
the
magician
disappeared
from
the
stage
together
with
his
faded
armchair
and
it
must
be
said
that
the
public
took
absolutely
no
notice
of
it
carried
away
as
it
was
by
the
extraordinary
things
fagott
was
unfolding
on
stage
and
fagott
having
packed
off
the
punished
master
of
ceremonies
addressed
the
public
thus
all
righty
now
that
we
ve
kicked
that
nuisance
out
let
s
open
a
ladies
shop
and
all
at
once
the
floor
of
the
stage
was
covered
with
persian
carpets
huge
mirrors
appeared
lit
by
greenish
tubes
at
the
sides
and
between
the
mirrors
display
windows
and
in
them
the
merrily
astonished
spectators
saw
parisian
ladies
dresses
of
various
colours
and
cuts
in
some
of
the
windows
that
is
while
in
others
there
appeared
hundreds
of
ladies
hats
with
feathers
and
without
feathers
and
with
buckles
or
without
hundreds
of
shoes
black
white
yellow
leather
satin
suede
with
straps
with
stones
among
the
shoes
there
appeared
cases
of
perfume
mountains
of
handbags
of
antelope
hide
suede
silk
and
among
these
whole
heaps
of
little
elongated
cases
of
gold
metal
such
as
usually
contain
lipstick
a
redheaded
girl
appeared
from
devil
knows
where
in
a
black
evening
dress
a
girl
nice
in
all
respects
had
she
not
been
marred
by
a
queer
scar
on
her
neck
smiling
a
proprietary
smile
by
the
display
windows
fagott
grinning
sweetly
announced
that
the
firm
was
offering
perfectly
gratis
an
exchange
of
the
ladies
old
dresses
and
shoes
for
parisian
models
and
parisian
shoes
the
same
held
he
added
for
the
handbags
and
other
things
the
cat
began
scraping
with
his
hind
paw
while
his
front
paw
performed
the
gestures
appropriate
to
a
doorman
opening
a
door
the
girl
sang
out
sweetly
though
with
some
hoarseness
rolling
her
r
s
something
not
quite
comprehensible
but
judging
by
the
women

faces
in
the
stalls

the

bowed
the
girl
opened
the
glass
windows
welcome
yelled
fagott
with
no
embarrassment
or
ceremony
the
audience
was
excited
but
as
yet
no
one
ventured
on
stage
finally
some
brunette
stood
up
in
the
tenth
row
of
the
stalls
and
smiling
as
if
to
say
it
was
all
the
same
to
her
and
she
did
not
give
a
hoot
went
and
climbed
on
stage
by
the
side
stairs
bravo
fagott
shouted
greetings
to
the
first
customer
behemoth
a
chair
let
s
start
with
the
shoes
madame
the
brunette
sat
in
the
chair
and
fagott
at
once
poured
a
whole
heap
of
shoes
on
the
rug
in
front
of
her
the
brunette
removed
her
right
shoe
tried
a
lilac
one
stamped
on
the
rug
examined
the
heel
they
won
t
pinch
she
asked
pensively
to
this
fagott
exclaimed
with
a
hurt
air
come
come
and
the
cat
miaowed
resentfully
i
ll
take
this
pair
m
sieur
the
brunette
said
with
dignity
putting
on
the
second
shoe
as
well
the
brunette
s
old
shoes
were
tossed
behind
a
curtain
and
she
proceeded
there
herself
accompanied
by
the
redheaded
girl
and
fagott
who
was
carrying
several
fashionable
dresses
on
hangers
the
cat
bustled
about
helped
and
for
greater
importance
hung
a
measuring
tape
around
his
neck
a
minute
later
the
brunette
came
from
behind
the
curtain
in
such
a
dress
that
the
stalls
all
let
out
a
gasp
the
brave
woman
who
had
become
astonishingly
prettier
stopped
at
the
mirror
moved
her
bare
shoulders
touched
the
hair
on
her
nape
and
twisting
tried
to
peek
at
her
back
the
firm
asks
you
to
accept
this
as
a
souvenir
said
fagott
and
he
offered
the
brunette
an
open
case
with
a
flacon
in
it
merci
the
brunette
said
haughtily
and
went
down
the
steps
to
the
stalls
as
she
walked
the
spectators
jumped
up
and
touched
the
case
and
here
there
came
a
clean
breakthrough
and
from
all
sides
women
marched
on
to
the
stage
amid
the
general
agitation
of
talk
chuckles
and
gasps
a
man
s
voice
was
heard
i
won
t
allow
it
and
a
woman
s
despot
and
philistine
don
t
break
my
arm
women
disappeared
behind
the
curtain
leaving
their
dresses
there
and
coming
out
in
new
ones
a
whole
row
of
ladies
sat
on
stools
with
gilded
legs
stamping
the
carpet
energetically
with
newly
shod
feet
fagott
was
on
his
knees
working
away
with
a
metal
shoehorn
the
cat
fainting
under
piles
of
purses
and
shoes
plodded
back
and
forth
between
the
display
windows
and
the
stools
the
girl
with
the
disfigured
neck
appeared
and
disappeared
and
reached
the
point
where
she
started
rattling
away
entirely
in
french
and
surprisingly
the
women
all
understood
her
from
half
a
word
even
those
who
did
not
know
a
single
word
of
french
general
amazement
was
aroused
by
a
man
edging
his
way
onstage
he
announced
that
his
wife
had
the
flu
and
he
therefore
asked
that
something
be
sent
to
her
through
him
as
proof
that
he
was
indeed
married
the
citizen
was
prepared
to
show
his
passport
the
solicitous
husband
s
announcement
was
met
with
guffaws
fagott
shouted
that
he
believed
him
like
his
own
self
even
without
the
passport
and
handed
the
citizen
two
pairs
of
silk
stockings
and
the
cat
for
his
part
added
a
little
tube
of
lipstick
latecoming
women
tore
on
to
the
stage
and
off
the
stage
the
lucky
ones
came
pouring
down
in
ball
gowns
pyjamas
with
dragons
sober
formal
outfits
little
hats
tipped
over
one
eyebrow
then
fagott
announced
that
owing
to
the
lateness
of
the
hour
the
shop
would
close
in
exactly
one
minute
until
the
next
evening
and
an
unbelievable
scramble
arose
onstage
women
hastily
grabbed
shoes
without
trying
them
on
one
burst
behind
the
curtain
like
a
storm
got
out
of
her
dress
there
took
possession
of
the
first
thing
that
came
to
hand
a
silk
dressinggown
covered
with
huge
bouquets
and
managed
to
pick
up
two
cases
of
perfume
besides
exactly
a
minute
later
a
pistol
shot
rang
out
the
mirrors
disappeared
the
display
windows
and
stools
dropped
away
the
carpet
melted
into
air
as
did
the
curtain
last
to
disappear
was
the
high
mountain
of
old
dresses
and
shoes
and
the
stage
was
again
severe
empty
and
bare
and
it
was
here
that
a
new
character
mixed
into
the
affair
a
pleasant
sonorous
and
very
insistent
baritone
came
from
box
no
all
the
same
it
is
desirable
citizen
artiste
that
you
expose
the
technique
of
your
tricks
to
the
spectators
without
delay
especially
the
trick
with
the
paper
money
it
is
also
desirable
that
the
master
of
ceremonies
return
to
the
stage
the
spectators
are
concerned
about
his
fate
the
baritone
belonged
to
none
other
than
that
evening
s
guest
of
honour
arkady
apollonovich
sempleyarov
chairman
of
the
acoustics
commission
of
the
moscow
theatres
arkady
apollonovich
was
in
his
box
with
two
ladies
the
older
one
dressed
expensively
and
fashionably
the
other
one
young
and
pretty
dressed
in
a
simpler
way
the
first
as
was
soon
discovered
during
the
drawing
up
of
the
report
was
arkady
apollonovich
s
wife
and
the
second
was
his
distant
relation
a
promising
debutante
who
had
come
from
saratov
and
was
living
in
the
apartment
of
arkady
apollonovich
and
his
wife
pardone
fagott
replied
i
m
sorry
there
s
nothing
here
to
expose
it
s
all
clear
no
excuse
me
the
exposure
is
absolutely
necessary
without
it
your
brilliant
numbers
will
leave
a
painful
impression
the
mass
of
spectators
demands
an
explanation
the
mass
of
spectators
the
impudent
clown
interrupted
sempleyarov
doesn
t
seem
to
be
saying
anything
but
in
consideration
of
your
most
esteemed
desire
arkady
apollonovich
so
be
it
i
will
perform
an
exposure
but
to
that
end
will
you
allow
me
one
more
tiny
number
why
not
arkady
apollonovich
replied
patronizingly
but
there
must
be
an
exposure
very
well
very
well
sir
and
so
allow
me
to
ask
where
were
you
last
evening
arkady
apollonovich
at
this
inappropriate
and
perhaps
even
boorish
question
arkady
apollonovich
s
countenance
changed
and
changed
quite
drastically
last
evening
arkady
apollonovich
was
at
a
meeting
of
the
acoustics
commission
arkady
apollonovich
s
wife
declared
very
haughtily
but
i
don
t
understand
what
that
has
got
to
do
with
magic
ouee
madame
fagott
agreed
naturally
you
don
t
understand
as
for
the
meeting
you
are
totally
deluded
after
driving
off
to
the
said
meeting
which
incidentally
was
not
even
scheduled
for
last
night
arkady
apollonovich
dismissed
his
chauffeur
at
the
acoustics
commission
building
on
clean
ponds
the
whole
theatre
became
hushed
and
went
by
bus
to
yelokhovskaya
street
to
visit
an
actress
from
the
regional
itinerant
theatre
militsa
andreevna
pokobatko
with
whom
he
spent
some
four
hours
aie
someone
cried
out
painfully
in
the
total
silence
arkady
apollonovich
s
young
relation
suddenly
broke
into
a
low
and
terrible
laugh
it
s
all
clear
she
exclaimed
and
i
ve
long
suspected
it
now
i
see
why
that
giftless
thing
got
the
role
of
louisa
and
swinging
suddenly
she
struck
arkady
apollonovich
on
the
head
with
her
short
and
fat
violet
umbrella
meanwhile
the
scoundrelly
fagott
alias
koroviev
was
shouting
here
honourable
citizens
is
one
case
of
the
exposure
arkady
apollonovich
so
importunately
insisted
on
how
dare
you
touch
arkady
apollonovich
you
vile
creature
arkady
apollonovich
s
wife
asked
threateningly
rising
in
the
box
to
all
her
gigantic
height
a
second
brief
wave
of
satanic
laughter
seized
the
young
relation
who
else
should
dare
touch
him
she
answered
guffawing
if
not
me
and
for
the
second
time
there
came
the
dry
crackling
sound
of
the
umbrella
bouncing
off
the
head
of
arkady
apollonovich
police
seize
her
sempleyarov
s
wife
shouted
in
such
a
terrible
voice
that
many
hearts
went
cold
and
here
the
cat
also
leaped
out
to
the
footlights
and
suddenly
barked
in
a
human
voice
for
all
the
theatre
to
hear
the
seance
is
over
maestro
hack
out
a
march
the
halfcrazed
conductor
unaware
of
what
he
was
doing
waved
his
baton
and
the
orchestra
did
not
play
or
even
strike
up
or
even
bang
away
at
but
precisely
in
the
cat
s
loathsome
expression
hacked
out
some
incredible
march
of
an
unheardof
brashness
for
a
moment
there
was
an
illusion
of
having
heard
once
upon
a
time
under
southern
stars
in
a
caféchantant
some
barely
intelligible
halfblind
but
rollicking
words
to
this
marchhis
excellency
reached
the
stageof
liking
barnyard
fowlhe
took
under
his
patronagethree
young
girls
and
an
owl
or
maybe
these
were
not
the
words
at
all
but
there
were
others
to
the
same
music
extremely
indecent
ones
that
is
not
the
important
thing
the
important
thing
is
that
after
all
this
something
like
babel
broke
loose
in
the
variety
the
police
went
running
to
sempleyarov
s
box
people
were
climbing
over
the
barriers
there
were
bursts
of
infernal
guffawing
and
furious
shouts
drowned
in
the
golden
clash
of
the
orchestra
s
cymbals
and
one
could
see
that
the
stage
was
suddenly
empty
and
that
the
hoodwinker
fagott
as
well
as
the
brazen
tomcat
behemoth
had
melted
into
air
vanished
as
the
magician
had
vanished
earlier
in
his
armchair
with
the
faded
upholstery
chapter
the
hero
enters
and
so
the
unknown
man
shook
his
finger
at
ivan
and
whispered
shhh
ivan
lowered
his
legs
from
the
bed
and
peered
cautiously
looking
into
the
room
from
the
balcony
was
a
cleanshaven
darkhaired
man
of
approximately
thirtyeight
with
a
sharp
nose
anxious
eyes
and
a
wisp
of
hair
hanging
down
on
his
forehead
having
listened
and
made
sure
that
ivan
was
alone
the
mysterious
visitor
took
heart
and
stepped
into
the
room
here
ivan
saw
that
the
man
was
dressed
as
a
patient
he
was
wearing
long
underwear
slippers
on
his
bare
feet
and
a
brown
dressinggown
thrown
over
his
shoulders
the
visitor
winked
at
ivan
hid
a
bunch
of
keys
in
his
pocket
inquired
in
a
whisper
may
i
sit
down
and
receiving
an
affirmative
nod
placed
himself
in
an
armchair
how
did
you
get
here
ivan
asked
in
a
whisper
obeying
the
dry
finger
shaken
at
him
aren
t
the
balcony
grilles
locked
the
grilles
are
locked
the
guest
agreed
but
praskovya
fyodorovna
while
the
dearest
person
is
also
alas
quite
absentminded
a
month
ago
i
stole
a
bunch
of
keys
from
her
and
so
gained
the
opportunity
of
getting
out
on
to
the
common
balcony
which
runs
around
the
entire
floor
and
so
of
occasionally
calling
on
a
neighbour
if
you
can
get
out
on
to
the
balcony
you
can
escape
or
is
it
high
up
ivan
was
interested
no
the
guest
replied
firmly
i
cannot
escape
from
here
not
because
it
s
high
up
but
because
i
have
nowhere
to
escape
to
and
he
added
after
a
pause
so
here
we
sit
here
we
sit
ivan
replied
peering
into
the
man
s
brown
and
very
restless
eyes
yes
here
the
guest
suddenly
became
alarmed
but
you
re
not
violent
i
hope
because
you
know
i
cannot
stand
noise
turmoil
force
or
other
things
like
that
especially
hateful
to
me
are
people
s
cries
whether
cries
of
rage
suffering
or
anything
else
set
me
at
ease
tell
me
you
re
not
violent
yesterday
in
a
restaurant
i
socked
one
type
in
the
mug
the
transformed
poet
courageously
confessed
your
grounds
the
guest
asked
sternly
no
grounds
i
must
confess
ivan
answered
embarrassed
outrageous
the
guest
denounced
ivan
and
added
and
besides
what
a
way
to
express
yourself
socked
in
the
mug
it
is
not
known
precisely
whether
a
man
has
a
mug
or
a
face
and
after
all
it
may
well
be
a
face
so
you
know
using
fists
no
you
should
give
that
up
and
for
good
having
thus
reprimanded
ivan
the
guest
inquired
your
profession
poet
ivan
confessed
reluctantly
for
some
reason
the
visitor
became
upset
ah
just
my
luck
he
exclaimed
but
at
once
reconsidered
apologized
and
asked
and
what
is
your
name
homeless
ohoh
the
guest
said
wincing
what
you
mean
you
dislike
my
poetry
ivan
asked
with
curiosity
i
dislike
it
terribly
and
what
have
you
read
i
ve
never
read
any
of
your
poetry
the
visitor
exclaimed
nervously
then
how
can
you
say
that
well
what
of
it
the
guest
replied
as
if
i
haven
t
read
others
or
else
maybe
there
s
some
miracle
very
well
i
m
ready
to
take
it
on
faith
is
your
poetry
good
you
tell
me
yourself
monstrous
ivan
suddenly
spoke
boldly
and
frankly
don
t
write
any
more
the
visitor
asked
beseechingly
i
promise
and
i
swear
ivan
said
solemnly
the
oath
was
sealed
with
a
handshake
and
here
soft
footsteps
and
voices
were
heard
in
the
corridor
shh
the
guest
whispered
and
jumping
out
to
the
balcony
closed
the
grille
behind
him
praskovya
fyodorovna
peeked
in
asked
ivan
how
he
was
feeling
and
whether
he
wished
to
sleep
in
the
dark
or
with
a
light
ivan
asked
her
to
leave
the
light
on
and
praskovya
fyodorovna
withdrew
wishing
the
patient
a
good
night
and
when
everything
was
quiet
the
guest
came
back
again
he
informed
ivan
in
a
whisper
that
there
was
a
new
arrival
in
room
some
fat
man
with
a
purple
physiognomy
who
kept
muttering
something
about
currency
in
the
ventilation
and
swearing
that
unclean
powers
were
living
in
their
place
on
sadovaya
he
curses
pushkin
up
and
down
and
keeps
shouting
kurolesov
encore
encore
the
guest
said
twitching
nervously
having
calmed
himself
he
sat
down
said
anyway
god
help
him
and
continued
his
conversation
with
ivan
so
how
did
you
wind
up
here
on
account
of
pontius
pilate
ivan
replied
casting
a
glum
look
at
the
floor
what
the
guest
cried
forgetting
all
caution
and
clapped
his
hand
over
his
own
mouth
a
staggering
coincidence
tell
me
about
it
i
beg
you
i
beg
you
feeling
trust
in
the
unknown
man
for
some
reason
ivan
began
falteringly
and
timorously
at
first
then
more
boldly
to
tell
about
the
previous
day
s
story
at
the
patriarch
s
ponds
yes
it
was
a
grateful
listener
that
ivan
nikolaevich
acquired
in
the
person
of
the
mysterious
stealer
of
keys
the
guest
did
not
take
ivan
for
a
madman
he
showed
great
interest
in
what
he
was
being
told
and
as
the
story
developed
finally
became
ecstatic
time
and
again
he
interrupted
ivan
with
exclamations
well
well
go
on
go
on
i
beg
you
only
in
the
name
of
all
that
s
holy
don
t
leave
anything
out
ivan
left
nothing
out
in
any
case
it
was
easier
for
him
to
tell
it
that
way
and
he
gradually
reached
the
moment
when
pontius
pilate
in
a
white
mantle
with
bloodred
lining
came
out
to
the
balcony
then
the
visitor
put
his
hands
together
prayerfully
and
whispered
oh
how
i
guessed
how
i
guessed
it
all
the
listener
accompanied
the
description
of
berlioz
s
terrible
death
with
an
enigmatic
remark
while
his
eyes
flashed
with
spite
i
only
regret
that
it
wasn
t
the
critic
latunsky
or
the
writer
mstislav
lavrovich
instead
of
this
berlioz
and
he
cried
out
frenziedly
but
soundlessly
go
on
the
cat
handing
money
to
the
woman
conductor
amused
the
guest
exceedingly
and
he
choked
with
quiet
laughter
watching
as
ivan
excited
by
the
success
of
his
narration
quietly
hopped
on
bent
legs
portraying
the
cat
holding
the
coin
up
next
to
his
whiskers
and
so
ivan
concluded
growing
sad
and
melancholy
after
telling
about
the
events
at
griboedov
s
i
wound
up
here
the
guest
sympathetically
placed
a
hand
on
the
poor
poet
s
shoulder
and
spoke
thus
unlucky
poet
but
you
yourself
dear
heart
are
to
blame
for
it
all
you
oughtn
t
to
have
behaved
so
casually
and
even
impertinently
with
him
so
you
ve
paid
for
it
and
you
must
still
say
thank
you
that
you
got
off
comparatively
cheaply
but
who
is
he
finally
ivan
asked
shaking
his
fists
in
agitation
the
guest
peered
at
ivan
and
answered
with
a
question
you
re
not
going
to
get
upset
we
re
all
unreliable
here
there
won
t
be
any
calling
for
the
doctor
injections
or
other
fuss
no
no
ivan
exclaimed
tell
me
who
is
he
very
well
the
visitor
replied
and
he
said
weightily
and
distinctly
yesterday
at
the
patriarch
s
ponds
you
met
satan
ivan
did
not
get
upset
as
he
had
promised
but
even
so
he
was
greatly
astounded
that
can
t
be
he
doesn
t
exist
good
heavens
anyone
else
might
say
that
but
not
you
you
were
apparently
one
of
his
first
victims
you
re
sitting
as
you
yourself
understand
in
a
psychiatric
clinic
yet
you
keep
saying
he
doesn
t
exist
really
it
s
strange
thrown
off
ivan
fell
silent
as
soon
as
you
started
describing
him
the
guest
went
on
i
began
to
realize
who
it
was
that
you
had
the
pleasure
of
talking
with
yesterday
and
really
i
m
surprised
at
berlioz
now
you
of
course
are
a
virginal
person
here
the
guest
apologized
again
but
that
one
from
what
i
ve
heard
about
him
had
after
all
read
at
least
something
the
very
first
things
this
professor
said
dispelled
all
my
doubts
one
can
t
fail
to
recognize
him
my
friend
though
you
again
i
must
apologize
but
i
m
not
mistaken
you
are
an
ignorant
man
indisputably
the
unrecognizable
ivan
agreed
well
so
even
the
face
as
you
described
it
the
different
eyes
the
eyebrows
forgive
me
however
perhaps
you
ve
never
even
heard
the
operafaust
ivan
became
terribly
embarrassed
for
some
reason
and
his
face
aflame
began
mumbling
something
about
some
trip
to
a
sanatorium
to
yalta
well
so
so
hardly
surprising
but
berlioz
i
repeat
astounds
me
he
s
not
only
a
wellread
man
but
also
a
very
shrewd
one
though
i
must
say
in
his
defence
that
woland
is
of
course
capable
of
pulling
the
wool
over
the
eyes
of
an
even
shrewder
man
what
ivan
cried
out
in
his
turn
hush
ivan
slapped
himself
roundly
on
the
forehead
with
his
palm
and
rasped
i
see
i
see
he
had
the
letter
w
on
his
visiting
card
aiyaiyai
what
a
thing
he
lapsed
into
a
bewildered
silence
for
some
time
peering
at
the
moon
floating
outside
the
grille
and
then
spoke
so
that
means
he
might
actually
have
been
at
pontius
pilate
s
he
was
already
born
then
and
they
call
me
a
madman
ivan
added
indignantly
pointing
to
the
door
a
bitter
wrinkle
appeared
on
the
guest
s
lips
let
s
look
the
truth
in
the
eye
and
the
guest
turned
his
face
towards
the
nocturnal
luminary
racing
through
a
cloud
you
and
i
are
both
madmen
there
s
no
denying
that
you
see
he
shocked
you
and
you
came
unhinged
since
you
evidently
had
the
ground
prepared
for
it
but
what
you
describe
undoubtedly
took
place
in
reality
but
it
s
so
extraordinary
that
even
stravinsky
a
psychiatrist
of
genius
did
not
of
course
believe
you
did
he
examine
you
ivan
nodded
your
interlocutor
was
at
pilate
s
and
had
breakfast
with
kant
and
now
he
s
visiting
moscow
but
he
ll
be
up
to
devil
knows
what
here
oughtn
t
we
to
catch
him
somehow
the
former
not
yet
definitively
quashed
ivan
still
raised
his
head
though
without
much
confidence
in
the
new
ivan
you
ve
already
tried
and
that
will
do
for
you
the
guest
replied
ironically
i
don
t
advise
others
to
try
either
and
as
for
being
up
to
something
rest
assured
he
will
be
ah
ah
but
how
annoying
that
it
was
you
who
met
him
and
not
i
though
it
s
all
burned
up
and
the
coals
havegone
to
ashes
still
i
swear
for
that
meeting
i
d
give
praskovya
fyodorovna
s
bunch
of
keys
for
i
have
nothing
else
to
give
i
m
destitute
but
what
do
you
need
him
for
the
guest
paused
ruefully
for
a
long
time
and
twitched
but
finally
spoke
you
see
it
s
such
a
strange
story
i
m
sitting
here
for
the
same
reason
you
are
namely
on
account
of
pontius
pilate
here
the
guest
looked
around
fearfully
and
said
the
thing
is
that
a
year
ago
i
wrote
a
novel
about
pilate
you
re
a
writer
the
poet
asked
with
interest
the
guest
s
face
darkened
and
he
threatened
ivan
with
his
fist
then
said
i
am
a
master
he
grew
stem
and
took
from
the
pocket
of
his
dressinggown
a
completely
greasy
black
cap
with
the
letter
m
embroidered
on
it
in
yellow
silk
he
put
this
cap
on
and
showed
himself
to
ivan
both
in
profile
and
full
face
to
prove
that
he
was
a
master
she
sewed
it
for
me
with
her
own
hands
he
added
mysteriously
and
what
is
your
name
i
no
longer
have
a
name
the
strange
guest
answered
with
gloomy
disdain
i
renounced
it
as
i
generally
did
everything
in
life
let
s
forget
it
then
at
least
tell
me
about
the
novel
ivan
asked
delicately
if
you
please
sir
my
life
it
must
be
said
has
taken
a
not
very
ordinary
course
the
guest
began
a
historian
by
education
he
had
worked
until
two
years
ago
at
one
of
the
moscow
museums
and
besides
that
had
also
done
translations
from
what
languages
ivan
interrupted
curiously
i
know
five
languages
besides
my
own
replied
the
guest
english
french
german
latin
and
greek
well
i
can
also
read
italian
a
little
oh
my
ivan
whispered
enviously
the
historian
had
lived
solitarily
had
no
family
anywhere
and
almost
no
acquaintances
in
moscow
and
just
think
one
day
he
won
a
hundred
thousand
roubles
imagine
my
astonishment
the
guest
in
the
black
cap
whispered
when
i
put
my
hand
in
the
basket
of
dirty
laundry
and
lo
and
behold
it
had
the
same
number
as
in
the
newspaper
a
state
bond
he
explained
they
gave
it
to
me
at
the
museum
having
won
a
hundred
thousand
roubles
ivan
s
mysterious
guest
acted
thus
bought
books
gave
up
his
room
on
myasnitskaya
ohh
that
accursed
hole
he
growled
and
rented
from
a
builder
in
a
lane
near
the
arbat
two
rooms
in
the
basement
of
a
little
house
in
the
garden
he
left
his
work
at
the
museum
and
began
writing
a
novel
about
pontius
pilate
ah
that
was
a
golden
age
the
narrator
whispered
his
eyes
shining
a
completely
private
little
apartment
plus
a
front
hall
with
a
sink
in
it
he
underscored
for
some
reason
with
special
pride
little
windows
just
level
with
the
paved
walk
leading
from
the
gate
opposite
only
foursteps
away
near
the
fence
lilacs
a
linden
and
a
maple
ah
ah
ah
in
winter
it
was
very
seldom
that
i
saw
someone
s
black
feet
through
my
window
and
heard
the
snow
crunching
under
them
and
in
my
stove
a
fire
was
eternally
blazing
but
suddenly
spring
came
and
through
the
dim
glass
i
saw
lilac
bushes
naked
at
first
then
dressing
themselves
up
in
green
and
it
was
then
last
spring
that
something
happened
far
more
delightful
than
getting
a
hundred
thousand
roubles
and
that
you
must
agree
is
a
huge
sum
of
money
that
s
true
acknowledged
the
attentively
listening
ivan
i
opened
my
little
windows
and
sat
in
the
second
quite
minuscule
room
the
guest
began
measuring
with
his
arms
here
s
the
sofa
and
another
sofa
opposite
and
a
little
table
between
them
with
a
beautiful
night
lamp
on
it
and
books
nearer
the
window
and
here
a
small
writing
table
and
in
the
first
room
a
huge
room
one
hundred
and
fifty
square
feet
books
books
and
the
stove
ah
what
furnishings
i
had
the
extraordinary
smell
of
the
lilacs
and
my
head
was
getting
light
with
fatigue
and
pilate
was
flying
to
the
end
white
mantle
red
lining
i
understand
ivan
exclaimed
precisely
so
pilate
was
flying
to
the
end
to
the
end
and
i
already
knew
that
the
last
words
of
the
novel
would
be
the
fifth
procurator
of
judea
the
equestrian
pontius
pilate
well
naturally
i
used
to
go
out
for
a
walk
a
hundred
thousand
is
a
huge
sum
and
i
had
an
excellent
suit
or
i
d
go
and
have
dinner
in
some
cheap
restaurant
there
was
a
wonderful
restaurant
on
the
arbat
i
don
t
know
whether
it
exists
now
here
the
guest
s
eyes
opened
wide
and
he
went
on
whispering
gazing
at
the
moon
she
was
carrying
repulsive
alarming
yellow
flowers
in
her
hand
devil
knows
what
they
re
called
but
for
some
reason
they
re
the
first
to
appear
in
moscow
and
these
flowers
stood
out
clearly
against
her
black
spring
coat
she
was
carrying
yellow
flowers
not
a
nice
colour
she
turned
down
a
lane
from
tverskaya
and
then
looked
back
well
you
know
tverskaya
thousands
of
people
were
walking
along
tverskaya
but
i
can
assure
you
that
she
saw
me
alone
and
looked
not
really
alarmed
but
even
as
if
in
pain
and
i
was
struck
not
so
much
by
her
beauty
as
by
an
extraordinary
loneliness
in
her
eyes
such
as
no
one
had
ever
seen
before
obeying
this
yellow
sign
i
also
turned
down
the
lane
and
followed
her
we
walked
along
the
crooked
boring
lane
silently
i
on
one
side
she
on
the
other
and
imagine
there
was
not
a
soul
in
the
lane
i
was
suffering
because
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
was
necessary
to
speak
to
her
and
i
worried
that
i
wouldn
t
utter
a
single
word
and
she
would
leave
and
i
d
never
see
her
again
and
imagine
suddenly
she
began
to
speak
do
you
like
my
flowers
i
remember
clearly
the
sound
of
her
voice
rather
low
slightly
husky
and
stupid
as
it
is
it
seemed
that
the
echo
resounded
in
the
lane
and
bounced
off
the
dirty
yellow
wall
i
quickly
crossed
to
her
side
and
coming
up
to
her
answered
no
she
looked
at
me
in
surprise
and
i
suddenly
and
quite
unexpectedly
understood
that
all
my
life
i
had
loved
precisely
this
woman
quite
a
thing
eh
of
course
you
ll
say
i
m
mad
i
won
t
say
anything
ivan
exclaimed
and
added
i
beg
you
go
on
and
the
guest
continued
yes
she
looked
at
me
in
surprise
and
then
having
looked
asked
thus
you
generally
don
t
like
flowers
it
seemed
to
me
there
was
hostility
in
her
voice
i
was
walking
beside
her
trying
to
keep
in
step
and
to
my
surprise
did
not
feel
the
least
constraint
no
i
like
flowers
but
not
this
kind
i
said
which
then
i
like
roses
then
i
regretted
having
said
it
because
she
smiled
guiltily
and
threw
the
flowers
into
the
gutter
slightly
at
a
loss
i
nevertheless
picked
them
up
and
gave
them
to
her
but
she
with
a
smile
pushed
the
flowers
away
and
i
carried
them
in
my
hand
so
we
walked
silently
for
some
time
until
she
took
the
flowers
from
my
hand
and
threw
them
to
the
pavement
then
put
her
own
hand
in
a
black
glove
with
a
bellshaped
cuff
under
my
arm
and
we
walked
on
side
by
side
go
on
said
ivan
and
please
don
t
leave
anything
out
go
on
repeated
the
visitor
why
you
can
guess
for
yourself
how
it
went
on
he
suddenly
wiped
an
unexpected
tear
with
his
right
sleeve
and
continued
love
leaped
out
in
front
of
us
like
a
murderer
in
an
alley
leaping
out
of
nowhere
and
struck
us
both
at
once
as
lightning
strikes
as
a
finnish
knife
strikes
she
by
the
way
insisted
afterwards
that
it
wasn
t
so
that
we
had
of
course
loved
each
other
for
a
long
long
time
without
knowing
each
other
never
having
seen
each
other
and
that
she
was
living
with
a
different
man
as
i
was
too
then
with
that
what
sher
with
whom
asked
homeless
with
that
well
with
replied
the
guest
snapping
his
fingers
you
were
married
why
yes
that
s
why
i
m
snapping
with
that
varenka
manechka
no
varenka
striped
dress
the
museum
anyhow
i
don
t
remember
well
so
she
said
she
went
out
that
day
with
yellow
flowers
in
her
hand
so
that
i
would
find
her
at
last
and
that
if
it
hadn
t
happened
she
would
have
poisoned
herself
because
her
life
was
empty
yes
love
struck
us
instantly
i
knew
it
that
same
day
an
hour
later
when
without
having
noticed
the
city
we
found
ourselves
by
the
kremlin
wall
on
the
embankment
we
talked
as
if
we
had
parted
only
the
day
before
as
if
we
had
known
each
other
for
many
years
we
arranged
to
meet
the
next
day
at
the
same
place
on
the
moscow
river
and
we
did
the
may
sun
shone
down
on
us
and
soon
very
soon
this
woman
became
my
secret
wife
she
used
to
come
to
me
every
afternoon
but
i
would
begin
waiting
for
her
in
the
morning
this
waiting
expressed
itself
in
the
moving
around
of
objects
on
the
table
ten
minutes
before
i
would
sit
down
by
the
little
window
and
begin
to
listen
for
the
banging
of
the
decrepit
gate
and
how
curious
before
my
meeting
with
her
few
people
came
to
our
yard
more
simply
no
one
came
but
now
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
whole
city
came
flocking
there
bang
goes
the
gate
bang
goes
my
heart
and
imagine
it
s
inevitably
somebody
s
dirty
boots
level
with
my
face
behind
the
window
a
knifegrinder
now
who
needs
a
knifegrinder
in
our
house
to
sharpen
what
what
knives
she
would
come
through
the
gate
once
but
my
heart
would
pound
no
less
than
ten
times
before
that
i
m
not
lying
and
then
when
her
hour
came
and
the
hands
showed
noon
it
even
wouldn
t
stop
pounding
until
almost
without
tapping
almost
noiselessly
her
shoes
would
come
even
with
my
window
their
black
suede
bows
held
tightly
by
steel
buckles
sometimes
she
would
get
mischievous
pausing
at
the
second
window
and
tapping
the
glass
with
her
toe
that
same
instant
i
would
be
at
the
window
but
the
shoe
would
be
gone
the
black
silk
blocking
the
light
would
be
gone
i
d
go
and
open
the
door
for
her
no
one
knew
of
our
liaison
i
assure
you
of
that
though
it
never
happens
her
husband
didn
t
know
her
acquaintances
didn
t
know
in
the
old
house
where
i
had
that
basement
people
knew
of
course
they
saw
that
some
woman
visited
me
but
they
didn
t
know
her
name
but
who
is
she
asked
ivan
intrigued
in
the
highest
degree
by
this
love
story
the
guest
made
a
gesture
signifying
that
he
would
never
tell
that
to
anyone
and
went
on
with
his
story
ivan
learned
that
the
master
and
the
unknown
woman
loved
each
other
so
deeply
that
they
became
completely
inseparable
ivan
could
clearly
picture
to
himself
the
two
rooms
in
the
basement
of
the
house
where
it
was
always
twilight
because
of
the
lilacs
and
the
fence
the
worn
red
furniture
the
bureau
the
clock
on
it
which
struck
every
half
hour
and
books
books
from
the
painted
floor
to
the
sooty
ceiling
and
the
stove
ivan
learned
that
his
guest
and
his
secret
wife
from
the
very
first
days
of
their
liaison
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
fate
itself
had
thrown
them
together
at
the
corner
of
tverskaya
and
that
lane
and
that
they
had
been
created
for
each
other
for
all
time
ivan
learned
from
the
guest
s
story
how
the
lovers
would
spend
the
day
she
would
come
and
put
on
an
apron
first
thing
and
in
the
narrow
front
hall
where
stood
that
same
sink
of
which
the
poor
patient
was
for
some
reason
so
proud
would
light
the
kerosene
stove
on
the
wooden
table
prepare
lunch
and
set
it
out
on
the
oval
table
in
the
first
room
when
the
may
storms
came
and
water
rushed
noisily
through
the
gateway
past
the
nearsighted
windows
threatening
to
flood
their
last
refuge
the
lovers
would
light
the
stove
and
bake
potatoes
in
it
steam
rose
from
the
potatoes
the
black
potato
skins
dirtied
their
fingers
laughter
came
from
the
basement
the
trees
in
the
garden
after
rain
shed
broken
twigs
white
clusters
when
the
storms
ended
and
sultry
summer
came
there
appeared
in
the
vase
the
longawaited
roses
they
both
loved
the
man
who
called
himself
a
master
worked
feverishly
on
his
novel
and
this
novel
also
absorbed
the
unknown
woman
really
there
were
times
when
i
d
begin
to
be
jealous
of
it
on
account
of
her
the
night
visitor
come
from
the
moonlit
balcony
whispered
to
ivan
her
slender
fingers
with
sharply
filed
nails
buried
in
her
hair
she
endlessly
reread
what
he
had
written
and
after
rereading
it
would
sit
sewing
that
very
same
cap
sometimes
she
crouched
down
by
the
lower
shelves
or
stood
by
the
upper
ones
and
wiped
the
hundreds
of
dusty
spines
with
a
cloth
she
foretold
fame
she
urged
him
on
and
it
was
then
that
she
began
to
call
him
a
master
she
waited
impatiently
for
the
already
promised
last
words
about
the
fifth
procurator
of
judea
repeated
aloud
in
a
singsong
voice
certain
phrases
she
liked
and
said
that
her
life
was
in
this
novel
it
was
finished
in
the
month
of
august
was
given
to
some
unknown
typist
and
she
typed
it
in
five
copies
and
finally
the
hour
came
when
he
had
to
leave
his
secret
refuge
and
go
out
into
life
and
i
went
out
into
life
holding
it
in
my
hands
and
then
my
life
ended
the
master
whispered
and
drooped
his
head
and
for
a
long
time
nodded
the
woeful
black
cap
with
the
yellow
letter
m
on
it
he
continued
his
story
but
it
became
somewhat
incoherent
one
could
only
understand
that
some
catastrophe
had
then
befallen
ivan
s
guest
for
the
first
time
i
found
myself
in
the
world
of
literature
but
now
when
it
s
all
over
and
my
ruin
is
clear
i
recall
it
with
horror
the
master
whispered
solemnly
and
raised
his
hand
yes
he
astounded
me
greatly
ah
how
he
astounded
me
who
ivan
whispered
barely
audibly
fearing
to
interrupt
the
agitated
narrator
why
the
editor
i
tell
you
the
editor
yes
he
read
it
all
right
he
looked
at
me
as
if
i
had
a
swollen
cheek
looked
sidelong
into
the
corner
and
even
tittered
in
embarrassment
he
crumpled
the
manuscript
needlessly
and
grunted
the
questions
he
asked
seemed
crazy
to
me
saying
nothing
aboutthe
essence
of
the
novel
he
asked
me
who
i
was
where
i
came
from
and
how
long
i
had
been
writing
and
why
no
one
had
heard
of
me
before
and
even
asked
what
in
my
opinion
was
a
totally
idiotic
question
who
had
given
me
the
idea
of
writing
a
novel
on
such
a
strange
theme
finally
i
got
sick
of
him
and
asked
directly
whether
he
would
publish
the
novel
or
not
here
he
started
squirming
mumbled
something
and
declared
that
he
could
not
decide
the
question
on
his
own
that
other
members
of
the
editorial
board
had
to
acquaint
themselves
with
my
work
namely
the
critics
latunsky
and
arimanand
the
writer
mstislav
lavrovich
he
asked
me
to
come
in
two
weeks
i
came
in
two
weeks
and
was
received
by
some
girl
whose
eyes
were
crossed
towards
her
nose
from
constant
lying
that
s
lapshennikova
the
editorial
secretary
ivan
said
with
a
smirk
he
knew
very
well
the
world
described
so
wrathfully
by
his
guest
maybe
the
other
snapped
and
so
from
her
i
got
my
novel
back
already
quite
greasy
and
dishevelled
trying
to
avoid
looking
me
in
the
eye
lapshennikova
told
me
that
the
publisher
was
provided
with
material
for
two
years
ahead
and
therefore
the
question
of
printing
my
novel
as
she
put
it
did
not
arise
what
do
i
remember
after
that
the
master
muttered
rubbing
his
temple
yes
red
petals
strewn
across
the
title
page
and
also
the
eyes
of
my
friend
yes
those
eyes
i
remember
the
story
of
ivan
s
guest
was
becoming
more
confused
more
filled
with
all
sorts
of
reticences
he
said
something
about
slanting
rain
and
despair
in
the
basement
refuge
about
having
gone
elsewhere
he
exclaimed
in
a
whisper
that
he
did
not
blame
her
in
the
least
for
pushing
him
to
fight
oh
no
he
did
not
blame
her
further
on
as
ivan
heard
something
sudden
and
strange
happened
one
day
our
hero
opened
a
newspaper
and
saw
in
it
an
article
by
the
critic
ariman
in
which
ariman
warned
all
and
sundry
that
he
that
is
our
hero
had
attempted
to
foist
into
print
an
apology
for
jesus
christ
ah
i
remember
i
remember
ivan
cried
out
but
i
ve
forgotten
your
name
let
s
leave
my
name
out
of
it
i
repeat
it
no
longer
exists
replied
the
guest
that
s
not
the
point
two
days
later
in
another
newspaper
over
the
signature
of
mstislav
lavrovich
appeared
another
article
in
which
its
author
recommended
striking
and
striking
hard
at
pilatism
and
at
the
icondauber
who
had
ventured
to
foist
it
again
that
accursed
word
into
print
dumbfounded
by
this
unheardof
word
pilatism
i
opened
a
third
newspaper
there
were
two
articles
in
it
one
by
latunsky
the
other
signed
with
the
initials
ne
i
assure
you
the
works
of
ariman
and
lavrovich
could
be
counted
as
jokes
compared
with
what
latunsky
wrote
suffice
it
tosay
that
latunsky
s
article
was
entitled
a
militant
old
believer
i
got
so
carried
away
reading
the
article
about
myself
that
i
didn
t
notice
i
had
forgotten
to
lock
the
door
how
she
came
in
and
stood
before
me
with
a
wet
umbrella
in
her
hand
and
wet
newspapers
as
well
her
eyes
flashed
fire
her
trembling
hands
were
cold
first
she
rushed
to
kiss
me
then
in
a
hoarse
voice
and
pounding
the
table
with
her
fist
she
said
she
would
poison
latunsky
ivan
grunted
somewhat
embarrassedly
but
said
nothing
joyless
autumn
days
set
in
the
guest
went
on
the
monstrous
failure
with
this
novel
seemed
to
have
taken
out
a
part
of
my
soul
essentially
speaking
i
had
nothing
more
to
do
and
i
lived
from
one
meeting
with
her
to
the
next
and
it
was
at
that
time
that
something
happened
to
me
devil
knows
what
stravinsky
probably
figured
it
out
long
ago
namely
anguish
came
over
me
and
certain
forebodings
appeared
the
articles
please
note
did
not
cease
i
laughed
at
the
first
of
them
but
the
more
of
them
that
appeared
the
more
my
attitude
towards
them
changed
the
second
stage
was
one
of
astonishment
some
rare
falsity
and
insecurity
could
be
sensed
literally
in
every
line
of
these
articles
despite
their
threatening
and
confident
tone
i
had
the
feeling
and
i
couldn
t
get
rid
of
it
that
the
authors
of
these
articles
were
not
saying
what
they
wanted
to
say
and
that
their
rage
sprang
precisely
from
that
and
then
imagine
a
third
stage
came
of
fear
no
not
fear
of
these
articles
you
understand
but
fear
of
other
things
totally
unrelated
to
them
or
to
the
novel
thus
for
instance
i
began
to
be
afraid
of
the
dark
in
short
the
stage
of
mental
illness
came
it
seemed
to
me
especially
as
i
was
falling
asleep
that
some
very
cold
and
pliant
octopus
was
stealing
with
its
tentacles
immediately
and
directly
towards
my
heart
and
i
had
to
sleep
with
the
light
on
my
beloved
changed
very
much
of
course
i
never
told
her
about
the
octopus
but
she
could
see
that
something
was
going
wrong
with
me
she
became
thinner
and
paler
stopped
laughing
and
kept
asking
me
to
forgive
her
for
having
advised
me
to
publish
an
excerpt
she
said
i
should
drop
everything
and
go
to
the
south
to
the
black
sea
and
spend
all
that
was
left
of
the
hundred
thousand
on
the
trip
she
was
very
insistent
and
to
avoid
an
argument
something
told
me
i
was
not
to
go
to
the
black
sea
i
promised
her
that
i
d
do
it
one
of
those
days
but
she
said
she
would
buy
me
the
ticket
herself
then
i
took
out
all
my
money
that
is
about
ten
thousand
roubles
and
gave
it
to
her
why
so
much
she
was
surprised
i
said
something
or
other
about
being
afraid
of
thieves
and
asked
her
to
keep
the
money
until
my
departure
she
took
it
put
it
in
her
purse
began
kissing
me
and
saying
that
it
would
be
easier
for
her
to
die
than
to
leave
me
alone
in
such
a
state
but
that
she
was
expected
that
she
must
bow
tonecessity
that
she
would
come
the
next
day
she
begged
me
not
to
be
afraid
of
anything
this
was
at
dusk
in
midoctober
and
she
left
i
lay
down
on
the
sofa
and
fell
asleep
without
turning
on
the
light
i
was
awakened
by
the
feeling
that
the
octopus
was
there
groping
in
the
dark
i
barely
managed
to
turn
on
the
light
my
pocket
watch
showed
two
o
clock
in
the
morning
i
was
falling
ill
when
i
went
to
bed
and
i
woke
up
sick
it
suddenly
seemed
to
me
that
the
autumn
darkness
would
push
through
the
glass
and
pour
into
the
room
and
i
would
drown
in
it
as
in
ink
i
got
up
a
man
no
longer
in
control
of
himself
i
cried
out
the
thought
came
to
me
of
running
to
someone
even
if
it
was
my
landlord
upstairs
i
struggled
with
myself
like
a
madman
i
had
strength
enough
to
get
to
the
stove
and
start
a
fire
in
it
when
the
wood
began
to
crackle
and
the
stove
door
rattled
i
seemed
to
feel
slightly
better
i
dashed
to
the
front
room
turned
on
the
light
there
found
a
bottle
of
white
wine
uncorked
it
and
began
drinking
from
the
bottle
this
blunted
the
fear
somewhat
at
least
enough
to
keep
me
from
running
to
the
landlord
and
i
went
back
to
the
stove
i
opened
the
little
door
so
that
the
heat
began
to
burn
my
face
and
hands
and
whispered
guess
that
trouble
has
befallen
me
come
come
come
but
no
one
came
the
fire
roared
in
the
stove
rain
lashed
at
the
windows
then
the
final
thing
happened
i
took
the
heavy
manuscript
of
the
novel
and
the
draft
notebooks
from
the
desk
drawer
and
started
burning
them
this
was
terribly
hard
to
do
because
writtenon
paper
burns
reluctantly
breaking
my
fingernails
i
tore
up
the
notebooks
stuck
them
vertically
between
the
logs
and
ruffled
the
pages
with
the
poker
at
times
the
ashes
got
the
best
of
me
choking
the
flames
but
i
struggled
with
them
and
the
novel
though
stubbornly
resisting
was
nevertheless
perishing
familiar
words
flashed
before
me
the
yellow
climbed
steadily
up
the
pages
but
the
words
still
showed
through
it
they
would
vanish
only
when
the
paper
turned
black
and
i
finished
them
off
with
the
poker
just
then
someone
began
scratching
quietly
at
the
window
my
heart
leaped
and
having
stuffed
the
last
notebook
into
the
fire
i
rushed
to
open
the
door
brick
steps
led
up
from
the
basement
to
the
door
on
the
yard
stumbling
i
ran
up
to
it
and
asked
quietly
who
s
there
and
that
voice
her
voice
answered
it
s
me
i
don
t
remember
how
i
managed
with
the
chain
and
hook
as
soon
as
she
stepped
inside
she
clung
to
me
trembling
all
wet
her
cheeks
wet
and
her
hair
uncurled
i
could
only
utter
the
word
you
you
and
my
voice
broke
and
we
ran
downstairs
she
freed
herself
of
her
overcoat
in
the
front
hall
and
we
quickly
went
into
the
first
room
with
a
soft
cry
she
pulled
out
of
the
stove
with
her
bare
hands
and
threw
on
to
the
floor
the
last
of
what
was
there
a
sheaf
that
had
caught
fire
from
below
smoke
filled
the
room
at
once
i
stamped
out
the
fire
with
my
feet
and
she
collapsed
on
the
sofa
and
wept
irrepressibly
and
convulsively
when
she
calmed
down
i
said
i
came
to
hate
this
novel
and
i
m
afraid
i
m
ill
frightened
she
stood
up
and
said
god
how
sick
you
are
why
is
it
why
but
i
ll
save
you
i
ll
save
you
what
is
all
this
i
saw
her
eyes
swollen
with
smoke
and
weeping
felt
her
cold
hands
stroke
my
forehead
i
ll
cure
you
i
ll
cure
you
she
was
murmuring
clutching
my
shoulders
you
ll
restore
it
why
why
didn
t
i
keep
a
copy
she
bared
her
teeth
with
rage
she
said
something
else
inarticulately
then
compressing
her
lips
she
began
to
collect
and
smooth
out
the
burntedged
pages
it
was
some
chapter
from
the
middle
of
the
novel
i
don
t
remember
which
she
neatly
stacked
the
pages
wrapped
them
in
paper
tied
themwith
a
ribbon
all
her
actions
showed
that
she
was
full
of
determination
and
that
she
had
regained
control
of
herself
she
asked
for
wine
and
having
drunk
it
spoke
more
calmly
this
is
how
one
pays
for
lying
she
said
and
i
don
t
want
to
lie
any
more
i
d
stay
with
you
right
now
but
i
d
rather
not
do
it
that
way
i
don
t
want
it
to
remain
for
ever
in
his
memory
that
i
ran
away
from
him
in
the
middle
of
the
night
he
s
never
done
me
any
wrong
hewas
summoned
unexpectedly
there
was
a
fire
at
the
factory
but
he
ll
be
back
soon
i
ll
talk
with
him
tomorrow
morning
i
ll
tell
him
that
i
love
another
man
and
come
back
to
you
for
ever
or
maybe
you
don
t
want
that
answer
me
poor
dear
my
poor
dear
i
said
to
her
i
won
t
allow
you
to
do
it
things
won
t
go
well
for
me
and
i
don
t
want
you
to
perish
with
me
is
that
the
only
reason
she
asked
and
brought
her
eyes
close
to
mine
the
only
one
she
became
terribly
animated
she
clung
to
me
put
her
arms
around
my
neck
and
said
i
m
perishing
with
you
in
the
morning
i
ll
be
here
and
so
the
last
thing
i
remember
from
my
life
is
a
strip
of
light
from
my
front
hall
and
in
that
strip
of
light
an
uncurled
strand
of
hair
her
beret
and
her
eyes
filled
with
determination
i
also
remember
the
black
silhouette
in
the
outside
doorway
and
the
white
package
i
d
see
you
home
but
it
s
beyond
my
strength
to
come
back
alone
i
m
afraid
don
t
be
afraid
bear
with
it
for
a
few
hours
tomorrow
morning
i
ll
be
here
those
were
her
last
words
in
my
life
shh
the
patient
suddenly
interrupted
himself
and
raised
a
finger
it
s
a
restless
moonlit
night
tonight
he
disappeared
on
to
the
balcony
ivan
heard
little
wheels
roll
down
the
corridor
someone
sobbed
or
cried
out
weakly
when
everything
grew
still
the
guest
came
back
and
announced
that
room
had
received
an
occupant
someone
had
been
brought
and
he
kept
asking
to
be
given
back
his
head
the
two
interlocutors
fell
anxiously
silent
but
having
calmed
down
they
returned
to
the
interrupted
story
the
guest
was
just
opening
his
mouth
but
the
night
was
indeed
a
restless
one
there
were
still
voices
in
the
corridor
and
the
guest
began
to
speak
into
ivan
s
ear
so
softly
that
what
he
told
him
was
known
only
to
the
poet
apart
from
the
first
phrase
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
she
left
me
there
came
a
knock
at
my
window
what
the
patient
whispered
into
ivan
s
ear
evidently
agitated
him
very
much
spasms
repeatedly
passed
over
his
face
fear
and
rage
swam
and
flitted
in
his
eyes
the
narrator
pointed
his
hand
somewhere
in
the
direction
of
the
moon
which
had
long
since
left
the
balcony
only
when
all
sounds
from
outside
ceased
to
reach
them
did
the
guest
move
away
from
ivan
and
begin
to
speak
more
loudly
yes
and
so
in
midjanuary
at
night
in
the
same
coat
but
with
the
buttons
torn
off
i
was
huddled
with
cold
in
my
little
yard
behind
me
were
snowdrifts
that
hid
the
lilac
bushes
and
before
me
and
below
my
little
windows
dimly
lit
covered
with
shades
i
bent
down
to
the
first
of
them
and
listened
a
gramophone
was
playing
in
my
rooms
that
was
all
i
heard
but
i
could
not
see
anything
i
stood
there
a
while
then
went
out
the
gate
to
the
lane
a
blizzard
was
frolicking
in
it
a
dog
dashing
under
my
feet
frightened
me
and
i
ran
away
from
it
to
the
other
side
the
cold
and
the
fear
that
had
become
my
constant
companion
were
driving
me
to
frenzy
i
had
nowhere
to
go
and
the
simplest
thing
of
course
would
have
been
to
throw
myself
under
a
tramcar
on
the
street
where
my
lane
came
out
from
far
off
i
could
see
those
lightfilled
icecovered
boxes
and
hear
their
loathsome
screeching
in
the
frost
but
my
dear
neighbour
the
whole
thing
was
that
fear
possessed
every
cell
of
my
body
and
just
as
i
was
afraid
of
the
dog
so
i
was
afraid
of
the
tramcar
yes
there
is
no
illness
in
this
place
worse
than
mine
i
assure
you
but
you
could
have
let
her
know
said
ivan
sympathizing
with
the
poor
patient
besides
she
has
your
money
she
did
keep
it
of
course
you
needn
t
doubt
that
of
course
she
kept
it
but
you
evidently
don
t
understand
me
or
rather
i
ve
lost
the
ability
i
once
had
for
describing
things
however
i
m
not
very
sorry
about
that
since
i
no
longer
have
any
use
for
it
before
her
the
guest
reverently
looked
out
at
the
darkness
of
the
night
there
would
lie
a
letter
from
a
madhouse
how
can
one
send
letters
from
such
an
address
a
mental
patient
you
re
joking
my
friend
make
her
unhappy
no
i
m
not
capable
of
that
ivan
was
unable
to
object
to
this
but
the
silent
ivan
sympathized
with
the
guest
he
commiserated
with
him
and
the
other
from
the
pain
of
his
memories
nodded
his
head
in
the
black
cap
and
spoke
thus
poor
woman
however
i
have
hopes
that
she
has
forgotten
me
but
you
may
recover
ivan
said
timidly
i
am
incurable
the
guest
replied
calmly
when
stravinsky
says
he
will
bring
me
back
to
life
i
don
t
believe
him
he
is
humane
and
simply
wants
to
comfort
me
i
don
t
deny
however
that
i
m
much
better
now
yes
so
where
did
i
leave
off
frost
those
flying
trams
i
knew
that
this
clinic
had
been
opened
and
set
out
for
it
on
foot
across
the
entire
city
madness
outside
the
city
i
probably
would
have
frozen
to
death
but
chance
saved
me
a
truck
had
broken
down
i
came
up
to
the
driver
it
was
some
three
miles
beyond
the
city
limits
and
to
my
surprise
he
took
pity
on
methe
truck
was
coming
here
and
he
took
me
along
i
got
away
with
having
my
left
toes
frostbitten
but
they
cured
that
and
now
this
is
the
fourth
month
that
i
ve
been
here
and
you
know
i
find
it
not
at
all
bad
here
one
mustn
t
make
grandiose
plans
dear
neighbour
really
i
for
instance
wanted
to
go
all
around
the
globe
well
so
it
turns
out
that
i
m
not
going
to
do
it
i
see
only
an
insignificant
piece
of
that
globe
i
suppose
it
s
not
the
very
best
there
is
on
it
but
i
repeat
it
s
not
so
bad
summer
is
coming
the
ivy
will
twine
up
on
to
the
balcony
so
praskovya
fyodorovna
promises
the
keys
have
broadened
my
possibilities
there
ll
be
the
moon
at
night
ah
it
s
gone
freshness
it
s
falling
past
midnight
time
to
go
tell
me
what
happened
afterwards
with
yeshua
and
pilate
ivan
asked
i
beg
you
i
want
to
know
ah
no
no
the
guest
replied
with
a
painful
twitch
i
cannot
recall
my
novel
without
trembling
and
your
acquaintance
from
the
patriarch
s
ponds
would
do
it
better
than
i
thank
you
for
the
conversation
goodbye
and
before
ivan
could
collect
his
senses
the
grille
closed
with
a
quiet
clang
and
the
guest
vanished
chapter
glory
to
the
cock
his
nerves
gave
out
as
they
say
and
rimsky
fled
to
his
office
before
they
finished
drawing
up
the
report
he
sat
at
his
desk
and
stared
with
inflamed
eyes
at
the
magic
banknotes
lying
before
him
the
findirector
s
wits
were
addled
a
steady
hum
came
from
outside
the
audience
poured
in
streams
from
the
variety
building
into
the
street
rimsky
s
extremely
sharpened
hearing
suddenly
caught
the
distant
trill
of
a
policeman
that
in
itself
never
bodes
anything
pleasant
but
when
it
was
repeated
and
to
assist
it
another
joined
in
more
authoritative
and
prolonged
and
to
them
was
added
a
clearly
audible
guffawing
and
even
some
hooting
the
findirector
understood
at
once
that
something
else
scandalous
and
vile
had
happened
in
the
street
and
that
however
much
he
wanted
to
wave
it
away
it
was
closely
connected
with
the
repulsive
seance
presented
by
the
black
magician
and
his
assistants
the
keeneared
findirector
was
not
mistaken
in
the
least
as
soon
as
he
cast
a
glance
out
the
window
on
to
sadovaya
his
face
twisted
and
he
did
not
whisper
but
hissed
so
i
thought
in
the
bright
glare
of
the
strongest
street
lights
he
saw
just
below
him
on
the
sidewalk
a
lady
in
nothing
but
a
shift
and
violet
bloomers
true
there
was
a
little
hat
on
the
lady
s
head
and
an
umbrella
in
her
hands
the
lady
who
was
in
a
state
of
utter
consternation
now
crouching
down
now
making
as
if
to
run
off
somewhere
was
surrounded
by
an
agitated
crowd
which
produced
the
very
guffawing
that
had
sent
a
shiver
down
the
findirector
s
spine
next
to
the
lady
somecitizen
was
flitting
about
trying
to
tear
off
his
summer
coat
and
in
his
agitation
simply
unable
to
manage
the
sleeve
in
which
his
arm
was
stuck
shouts
and
roaring
guffaws
came
from
yet
another
place
namely
the
left
entrance
and
turning
his
head
in
that
direction
grigory
danilovich
saw
a
second
lady
in
pink
underwear
she
leaped
from
the
street
to
the
sidewalk
striving
to
hide
in
the
hallway
but
the
audience
pouring
out
blocked
the
way
and
the
poor
victim
of
her
own
flightiness
and
passion
for
dressing
up
deceived
by
vile
fagott
s
firm
dreamed
of
only
one
thing
falling
through
the
earth
a
policeman
made
for
the
unfortunate
woman
drilling
the
air
with
his
whistle
and
after
the
policeman
hastened
some
merry
young
men
in
caps
it
was
they
who
produced
the
guffawing
and
hooting
a
skinny
moustachioed
cabby
flew
up
to
the
first
undressed
woman
and
dashingly
reined
in
his
bony
brokendown
nag
the
moustached
face
was
grinning
gleefully
rimsky
beat
himself
on
the
head
with
his
fist
spat
and
leaped
back
from
the
window
for
some
time
he
sat
at
his
desk
listening
to
the
street
the
whistling
at
various
points
reached
its
highest
pitch
then
began
to
subside
the
scandal
to
rimsky
s
surprise
was
somehow
liquidated
with
unexpected
swiftness
it
came
time
to
act
he
had
to
drink
the
bitter
cup
of
responsibility
the
telephones
had
been
repaired
during
the
third
part
he
had
to
make
calls
to
tell
what
had
happened
to
ask
for
help
lie
his
way
out
of
it
heap
everything
on
likhodeev
cover
up
for
himself
and
so
on
pah
the
devil
twice
the
upset
director
put
his
hand
on
the
receiver
and
twice
he
drew
it
back
and
suddenly
in
the
dead
silence
of
the
office
the
telephone
burst
out
ringing
by
itself
right
in
the
findirector
s
face
and
he
gave
a
start
and
went
cold
my
nerves
are
really
upset
though
he
thought
and
picked
up
the
receiver
he
recoiled
from
it
instantly
and
turned
whiter
than
paper
a
soft
but
at
the
same
time
insinuating
and
lewd
female
voice
whispered
into
the
receiver
don
t
call
anywhere
rimsky
it
ll
be
bad
the
receiver
straight
away
went
empty
with
gooseflesh
prickling
on
his
back
the
findirector
hung
up
the
telephone
and
for
some
reason
turned
to
look
at
the
window
behind
him
through
the
scant
and
still
barely
greening
branches
of
a
maple
he
saw
the
moon
racing
in
a
transparent
cloud
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
branches
for
some
reason
rimsky
went
on
gazing
at
them
and
the
longer
he
gazed
the
more
strongly
he
was
gripped
by
fear
with
great
effort
the
findirector
finally
turned
away
from
the
moonlit
window
and
stood
up
there
could
no
longer
be
any
question
of
phone
calls
and
now
the
findirector
was
thinking
of
only
one
thing
getting
out
of
the
theatre
as
quickly
as
possible
he
listened
the
theatre
building
was
silent
rimsky
realized
that
he
had
long
been
the
only
one
on
the
whole
second
floor
and
a
childish
irrepressible
fear
came
over
him
at
this
thought
he
could
not
think
without
shuddering
of
having
to
walk
alone
now
along
the
empty
corridors
and
down
the
stairs
feverishly
he
seized
the
hypnotist
s
banknotes
from
the
table
put
them
in
his
briefcase
and
coughed
so
as
to
cheer
himself
up
at
least
a
little
the
cough
came
out
slightly
hoarse
weak
and
here
it
seemed
to
him
that
a
whiff
of
some
putrid
dankness
was
coming
in
under
the
office
door
shivers
ran
down
the
findirector
s
spine
and
then
the
clock
also
rang
out
unexpectedly
and
began
to
strike
midnight
and
even
its
striking
provoked
shivers
in
the
findirector
but
his
heart
definitively
sank
when
he
heard
the
english
key
turning
quietly
in
the
lock
clutching
his
briefcase
with
damp
cold
hands
the
findirector
felt
that
if
this
scraping
in
the
keyhole
were
to
go
on
any
longer
he
would
break
down
and
give
a
piercing
scream
finally
the
door
yielded
to
someone
s
efforts
opened
and
varenukha
noiselessly
entered
the
office
rimsky
simply
sank
down
into
the
armchair
where
he
stood
because
his
legs
gave
way
drawing
a
deep
breath
he
smiled
an
ingratiating
smile
as
it
were
and
said
quietly
god
you
frightened
me
yes
this
sudden
appearance
might
have
frightened
anyone
you
like
and
yet
at
the
same
time
it
was
a
great
joy
at
least
one
little
end
peeped
out
in
this
tangled
affair
well
tell
me
quickly
well
well
rimsky
wheezed
grasping
at
this
little
end
what
does
it
all
mean
excuse
me
please
the
entering
man
replied
in
a
hollow
voice
closing
the
door
i
thought
you
had
already
left
and
varenukha
without
taking
his
cap
off
walked
to
the
armchair
and
sat
on
the
other
side
of
the
desk
it
must
be
said
that
varenukha
s
response
was
marked
by
a
slight
oddity
which
at
once
needled
the
findirector
who
could
compete
in
sensitivity
with
the
seismograph
of
any
of
the
world
s
best
stations
how
could
it
be
why
did
varenukha
come
to
the
findirector
s
office
if
he
thought
he
was
not
there
he
had
his
own
office
first
of
all
and
second
whichever
entrance
to
the
building
varenukha
had
used
he
would
inevitably
have
met
one
of
the
nightwatchmen
to
all
of
whom
it
had
been
announced
that
grigory
danilovich
was
staying
late
in
his
office
but
the
findirector
did
not
spend
long
pondering
this
oddity
he
had
other
problems
why
didn
t
you
call
what
are
all
these
shenanigans
about
yalta
well
it
s
as
i
was
saying
the
administrator
replied
sucking
as
if
he
were
troubled
by
a
bad
tooth
he
was
found
in
the
tavern
in
pushkino
in
pushkino
you
mean
just
outside
moscow
what
about
the
telegrams
from
yalta
the
devil
they
re
from
yalta
he
got
a
telegrapher
drunk
in
pushkino
and
the
two
of
them
started
acting
up
sending
telegrams
marked
yalta
among
other
things
aha
aha
well
all
right
all
right
rimsky
did
not
say
but
sang
out
his
eyes
lit
up
with
a
yellow
light
in
his
head
there
formed
the
festive
picture
of
styopa
s
shameful
dismissal
from
his
job
deliverance
the
findirector
s
longawaited
deliverance
from
this
disaster
in
the
person
of
likhodeev
and
maybe
stepan
bogdanovich
would
achieve
something
worse
than
dismissal
the
details
said
rimsky
banging
the
paperweight
on
the
desk
and
varenukha
began
giving
the
details
as
soon
as
he
arrived
where
the
findirector
had
sent
him
he
was
received
at
once
and
given
a
most
attentive
hearing
no
one
of
course
even
entertained
the
thought
that
styopa
could
be
in
yalta
everyone
agreed
at
once
with
varenukha
s
suggestion
that
likhodeev
was
of
course
at
the
yalta
in
pushkino
then
where
is
he
now
the
agitated
findirector
interrupted
the
administrator
well
where
else
could
he
be
the
administrator
replied
grinning
crookedly
in
a
soberingup
cell
naturally
well
well
how
nice
varenukha
went
on
with
his
story
and
the
more
he
told
the
more
vividly
there
unfolded
before
the
findirector
the
long
chain
of
likhodeev
s
boorish
and
outrageous
acts
and
every
link
in
this
chain
was
worse
than
the
one
before
the
drunken
dancing
in
the
arms
of
the
telegrapher
on
the
lawn
in
front
of
the
pushkino
telegraph
office
to
the
sounds
of
some
itinerant
barrelorgan
was
worth
something
the
chase
after
some
female
citizens
shrieking
with
terror
the
attempt
at
a
fight
with
the
barman
in
the
yalta
itself
scattering
green
onions
all
over
the
floor
of
the
same
yalta
smashing
eight
bottles
of
dry
white
aidanil
breaking
the
meter
when
the
taxidriver
refused
to
take
styopa
in
his
cab
threatening
to
arrest
the
citizens
who
attempted
to
stop
styopa
s
obnoxiousness
in
short
black
horror
styopa
was
well
known
in
moscow
theatre
circles
and
everyone
knew
that
the
man
was
no
gift
but
all
the
same
what
the
administrator
was
telling
about
him
was
too
much
even
for
styopa
yes
too
much
even
much
too
much
rimsky
s
needlesharp
glance
pierced
the
administrator
s
face
from
across
the
desk
and
the
longer
the
man
spoke
the
grimmer
those
eyes
became
the
more
lifelike
and
colourful
the
vile
details
with
which
the
administrator
furnished
his
story
the
less
the
findirector
believed
the
storyteller
and
when
varenukha
told
how
styopa
had
let
himself
go
so
far
as
to
try
to
resist
those
who
came
to
bring
him
back
to
moscow
the
findirector
already
knew
firmly
that
everything
the
administrator
who
had
returned
at
midnight
was
telling
him
everything
was
a
lie
a
lie
from
first
word
to
last
varenukha
never
went
to
pushkino
and
there
was
no
styopa
in
pushkino
there
was
no
drunken
telegrapher
there
was
no
broken
glass
in
the
tavern
styopa
did
not
get
tied
up
with
ropes
none
of
it
happened
as
soon
as
the
findirector
became
firmly
convinced
that
the
administrator
was
lying
to
him
fear
crept
over
his
body
starting
from
the
legs
and
twice
again
the
findirector
fancied
that
a
putrid
malarial
dankness
was
wafting
across
the
floor
never
for
a
moment
taking
his
eyes
off
the
administrator
who
squirmed
somehow
strangely
in
his
armchair
trying
not
to
get
out
of
the
blue
shade
of
the
desk
lamp
and
screening
himself
with
a
newspaper
in
some
remarkable
fashion
from
the
bothersome
light
the
findirector
was
thinking
of
only
one
thing
what
did
it
all
mean
why
was
he
being
lied
to
so
brazenly
in
the
silent
and
deserted
building
by
the
administrator
who
was
so
late
in
coming
back
to
him
and
the
awareness
of
danger
an
unknown
but
menacing
danger
began
to
gnaw
at
rimsky
s
soul
pretending
to
ignore
varenukha
s
dodges
and
tricks
with
the
newspaper
the
findirector
studied
his
face
now
almost
without
listening
to
the
yarn
varenukha
was
spinning
there
was
something
that
seemed
still
more
inexplicable
than
the
calumny
invented
god
knows
why
about
adventures
in
pushkino
and
that
something
was
the
change
in
the
administrator
s
appearance
and
manners
no
matter
how
the
man
pulled
the
ducklike
visor
of
his
cap
over
his
eyes
so
as
to
throw
a
shadow
on
his
face
no
matter
how
he
fidgeted
with
the
newspaper
the
findirector
managed
to
make
out
an
enormous
bruise
on
the
right
side
of
his
face
just
by
the
nose
besides
that
the
normally
fullblooded
administrator
was
now
pale
with
a
chalklike
unhealthy
pallor
and
on
this
stifling
night
his
neck
was
for
some
reason
wrapped
in
an
old
striped
scarf
add
to
that
the
repulsive
manner
the
administrator
had
acquired
during
the
time
of
his
absence
of
sucking
and
smacking
the
sharp
change
in
his
voice
which
had
become
hollow
and
coarse
and
the
furtiveness
and
cowardliness
in
his
eyes
and
one
could
boldly
say
that
ivan
savelyevich
varenukha
had
become
unrecognizable
something
else
burningly
troubled
the
findirector
but
he
was
unable
to
grasp
precisely
what
it
was
however
much
he
strained
his
feverish
mind
however
hard
he
peered
at
varenukha
one
thing
he
could
affirm
that
there
was
something
unprecedented
unnatural
in
this
combination
of
the
administrator
and
the
familiar
armchair
well
we
finally
overpowered
him
loaded
him
into
the
car
varenukha
boomed
peeking
from
behind
the
paper
and
covering
the
bruise
with
his
hand
rimsky
suddenly
reached
out
and
as
if
mechanically
tapping
his
fingers
on
the
table
at
the
same
time
pushed
the
electricbell
button
with
his
palm
and
went
numb
the
sharp
signal
ought
to
have
been
heard
without
fail
in
the
empty
building
but
no
signal
came
and
the
button
sank
lifelessly
into
the
wood
of
the
desk
the
button
was
dead
the
bell
broken
the
findirector
s
stratagem
did
not
escape
the
notice
of
varenukha
who
asked
twitching
with
a
clearly
malicious
fire
flickering
in
his
eyes
what
are
you
ringing
for
mechanically
the
findirector
replied
hollowly
jerking
his
hand
back
and
asked
in
turn
in
an
unsteady
voice
what
s
that
on
your
face
the
car
skidded
i
bumped
against
the
doorhandle
varenukha
said
looking
away
he
s
lying
the
findirector
exclaimed
mentally
and
here
his
eyes
suddenly
grew
round
and
utterly
insane
and
he
stared
at
the
back
of
the
armchair
behind
the
chair
on
the
floor
two
shadows
lay
crisscross
one
more
dense
and
black
the
other
faint
and
grey
the
shadow
of
the
back
of
the
chair
and
of
its
tapering
legs
could
be
seen
distinctly
on
the
floor
but
there
was
no
shadow
of
varenukha
s
head
above
the
back
of
the
chair
or
of
the
administrator
s
legs
under
its
legs
he
casts
no
shadow
rimsky
cried
out
desperately
in
his
mind
he
broke
into
shivers
varenukha
following
rimsky
s
insane
gaze
looked
furtively
behind
him
at
the
back
of
the
chair
and
realized
that
he
had
been
found
out
he
got
up
from
the
chair
the
findirector
did
likewise
and
made
one
step
back
from
the
desk
clutching
his
briefcase
in
his
hands
he
s
guessed
damn
him
always
was
clever
varenukha
said
grinning
spitefully
right
in
the
findirector
s
face
and
he
sprang
unexpectedly
from
the
chair
to
the
door
and
quickly
pushed
down
the
catch
on
the
lock
the
findirector
looked
desperately
behind
him
as
he
retreated
to
the
windowgiving
on
to
the
garden
and
in
this
window
flooded
with
moonlight
saw
the
face
of
a
naked
girl
pressed
against
the
glass
and
her
naked
arm
reaching
through
the
ventpane
and
trying
to
open
the
lower
latch
the
upper
one
was
already
open
it
seemed
to
rimsky
that
the
light
of
the
desk
lamp
was
going
out
and
the
desk
was
tilting
an
icy
wave
engulfed
rimsky
but
fortunately
for
him
he
got
control
of
himself
and
did
not
fall
he
had
enough
strength
left
to
whisper
but
not
cry
out
help
varenukha
guarding
the
door
hopped
up
and
down
by
it
staying
in
air
for
a
long
time
and
swaying
there
waving
his
hooked
fingers
in
rimsky
s
direction
he
hissed
and
smacked
winking
to
the
girl
in
the
window
she
began
to
hurry
stuck
her
redhaired
head
through
the
vent
reached
her
arm
down
as
far
as
she
could
her
nails
clawing
at
the
lower
latch
and
shaking
the
frame
her
arm
began
to
lengthen
rubberlike
and
became
covered
with
a
putrid
green
finally
the
dead
woman
s
green
fingers
got
hold
of
the
latch
knob
turned
it
and
the
frame
began
to
open
rimsky
cried
out
weakly
leaned
against
the
wall
and
held
his
briefcase
in
front
of
him
like
a
shield
he
realized
that
his
end
had
come
the
frame
swung
wide
open
but
instead
of
the
night
s
freshness
and
the
fragrance
of
the
lindens
the
smell
of
a
cellar
burst
into
the
room
the
dead
woman
stepped
on
to
the
windowsill
rimsky
clearly
saw
spots
of
decay
on
her
breast
and
just
then
the
joyful
unexpected
crowing
of
a
cock
came
from
the
garden
from
that
low
building
beyond
the
shooting
gallery
where
birds
participating
in
the
programme
were
kept
a
loud
trained
cock
trumpeted
announcing
that
dawn
was
rolling
towards
moscow
from
the
east
savage
fury
distorted
the
girl
s
face
she
emitted
a
hoarse
oath
and
at
the
door
varenukha
shrieked
and
dropped
from
the
air
to
the
floor
the
cockcrow
was
repeated
the
girl
clacked
her
teeth
and
her
red
hair
stood
on
end
with
the
third
crowing
of
the
cock
she
turned
and
flew
out
and
after
her
jumping
up
and
stretching
himself
horizontally
in
the
air
looking
like
a
flying
cupid
varenukha
slowly
floated
over
the
desk
and
out
the
window
white
as
snow
with
not
a
single
black
hair
on
his
head
the
old
man
who
still
recently
had
been
rimsky
rushed
to
the
door
undid
the
catch
opened
the
door
and
ran
hurtling
down
the
dark
corridor
at
the
turn
to
the
stairs
moaning
with
fear
he
felt
for
the
switch
and
the
stairway
lighted
up
on
the
stairs
the
shaking
trembling
old
man
fell
because
he
imagined
that
varenukha
had
softly
tumbled
on
top
of
him
having
run
downstairs
rimsky
saw
a
watchman
asleep
on
a
chair
by
the
box
office
in
the
lobby
rimsky
stole
past
him
on
tiptoe
and
slipped
out
the
main
entrance
outside
he
felt
slightly
better
he
recovered
his
senses
enough
to
realize
clutching
his
head
that
his
hat
had
stayed
behind
in
the
office
needless
to
say
he
did
not
go
back
for
it
but
breathless
ran
across
the
wide
street
to
the
opposite
comer
by
the
movie
theatre
near
which
a
dull
reddish
light
hovered
in
a
moment
he
was
there
no
one
had
time
to
intercept
the
cab
make
the
leningrad
express
i
ll
tip
you
well
the
old
man
said
breathing
heavily
and
clutching
his
heart
i
m
going
to
the
garage
the
driver
answered
hatefully
and
turned
away
then
rimsky
unlatched
his
briefcase
took
out
fifty
roubles
and
handed
them
to
the
driver
through
the
open
front
window
a
few
moments
later
the
rattling
car
was
flying
like
the
wind
down
sadovoye
ring
the
passenger
was
tossed
about
on
his
seat
and
in
the
fragment
of
mirror
hanging
in
front
of
the
driver
rimsky
saw
now
the
driver
s
happy
eyes
now
his
own
insane
ones
jumping
out
of
the
car
in
front
of
the
train
station
rimsky
cried
to
the
first
man
he
saw
in
a
white
apron
with
a
badge
first
class
single
i
ll
pay
thirty
he
was
pulling
the
banknotes
from
his
briefcase
crumpling
them
no
first
class
get
me
second
if
not
a
hard
bench
the
man
with
the
badge
kept
glancing
up
at
the
lighted
clock
face
as
he
tore
the
banknotes
from
rimsky
s
hand
five
minutes
later
the
express
train
disappeared
from
under
the
glass
vault
of
the
train
station
and
vanished
clean
away
in
the
darkness
and
with
it
vanished
rimsky
chapter
nikanor
ivanovich
s
dream
it
is
not
difficult
to
guess
that
the
fat
man
with
the
purple
physiognomy
who
was
put
in
room
of
the
clinic
was
nikanor
ivanovich
bosoy
he
got
to
professor
stravinsky
not
at
once
however
but
after
first
visiting
another
place
of
this
other
place
little
remained
in
nikanor
ivanovich
s
memory
he
recalled
only
a
desk
a
bookcase
and
a
sofa
there
a
conversation
was
held
with
nikanor
ivanovich
who
had
some
sort
of
haze
before
his
eyes
from
the
rush
of
blood
and
mental
agitation
but
the
conversation
came
out
somehow
strange
muddled
or
better
to
say
did
not
come
out
at
all
the
very
first
question
put
to
nikanor
ivanovich
was
the
following
are
you
nikanor
ivanovich
bosoy
chairman
of
the
house
committee
at
no
bis
on
sadovaya
street
to
this
nikanor
ivanovich
bursting
into
terrible
laughter
replied
literally
thus
i
m
nikanor
of
course
i
m
nikanor
but
what
the
deuce
kind
of
chairman
am
i
meaning
what
the
question
was
asked
with
a
narrowing
of
eyes
meaning
he
replied
that
if
i
was
chairman
i
should
have
determined
at
once
that
he
was
an
unclean
power
otherwise
what
is
it
a
cracked
pincenez
all
in
rags
what
kind
of
foreigner
s
interpreter
could
he
be
who
are
you
talking
about
nikanor
ivanovich
was
asked
koroviev
nikanor
ivanovich
cried
out
got
himself
lodged
in
our
apartment
number
fifty
write
it
down
koroviev
he
must
be
caught
at
once
write
it
down
the
sixth
entrance
he
s
there
where
did
you
get
the
currency
nikanor
ivanovich
was
asked
soulfully
as
god
is
true
as
god
is
almighty
nikanor
ivanovich
began
he
sees
everything
and
it
serves
me
right
i
never
laid
a
finger
on
it
never
even
suspected
what
it
was
this
currency
god
is
punishing
me
for
my
iniquity
nikanor
ivanovich
went
on
with
feeling
now
buttoning
now
unbuttoning
his
shirt
now
crossing
himself
i
took
i
took
but
i
took
ours
soviet
money
i
d
register
people
for
money
i
don
t
argue
it
happened
our
secretary
bedsornev
is
a
good
one
too
another
good
one
frankly
speaking
there
s
nothing
but
thieves
in
the
house
management
but
i
never
took
currency
to
the
request
that
he
stop
playing
the
fool
and
tell
how
the
dollars
got
into
the
ventilation
nikanor
ivanovich
went
on
his
knees
and
swayed
opening
his
mouth
as
if
he
meant
to
swallow
a
section
of
the
parquet
if
you
want
he
mumbled
i
ll
eat
dirt
that
i
didn
t
do
it
and
koroviev
he
s
the
devil
all
patience
has
its
limits
and
the
voice
at
the
desk
was
now
raised
hinting
to
nikanor
ivanovich
that
it
was
time
he
began
speaking
in
human
language
here
the
room
with
that
same
sofa
resounded
with
nikanor
ivanovich
s
wild
roaring
as
he
jumped
up
from
his
knees
there
he
is
there
behind
the
bookcase
he
s
grinning
and
his
pincenez
hold
him
spray
the
room
with
holy
water
the
blood
left
nikanor
ivanovich
s
face
trembling
he
made
crosses
in
the
air
rushing
to
the
door
and
back
intoned
some
prayer
and
finally
began
spouting
sheer
gibberish
it
became
perfectly
clear
that
nikanor
ivanovich
was
unfit
for
any
conversation
he
was
taken
out
and
put
in
a
separate
room
where
he
calmed
down
somewhat
and
only
prayed
and
sobbed
they
did
of
course
go
to
sadovaya
and
visit
apartment
no
but
they
did
not
find
any
koroviev
there
and
no
one
in
the
house
either
knew
or
had
seen
any
koroviev
the
apartment
occupied
by
the
late
berlioz
as
well
as
by
the
yaltavisiting
likhodeev
was
empty
and
in
the
study
wax
seals
hung
peacefully
on
the
bookcases
unbroken
by
anyone
with
that
they
left
sadovaya
and
there
also
departed
with
them
the
perplexed
and
dispirited
secretary
of
the
house
management
bedsornev
in
the
evening
nikanor
ivanovich
was
delivered
to
stravinsky
s
clinic
there
he
became
so
agitated
that
an
injection
made
according
to
stravinsky
s
recipe
had
to
be
given
him
and
only
after
midnight
did
nikanor
ivanovich
fall
asleep
in
room
every
now
and
then
emitting
a
heavy
painful
moan
but
the
longer
he
slept
the
easier
his
sleep
became
he
stopped
tossing
and
groaning
his
breathing
became
easy
and
regular
and
he
was
left
alone
then
nikanor
ivanovich
was
visited
by
a
dream
at
the
basis
of
which
undoubtedly
lay
the
experience
of
that
day
it
began
with
nikanor
ivanovich
seeing
as
it
were
some
people
with
golden
trumpets
in
their
hands
leading
him
and
very
solemnly
to
a
big
lacquered
door
at
this
door
his
companions
played
as
it
were
a
flourish
for
nikanor
ivanovich
and
then
from
the
sky
a
resounding
bass
said
merrily
welcome
nikanor
ivanovich
turn
over
your
currency
exceedingly
astonished
nikanor
ivanovich
saw
a
black
loudspeaker
above
him
then
he
found
himself
for
some
reason
in
a
theatre
house
where
crystal
chandeliers
blazed
under
a
gilded
ceiling
and
quinquet
lamps
on
the
walls
everything
was
as
it
ought
to
be
in
a
smallsized
but
very
costly
theatre
there
was
a
stage
closed
off
by
a
velvet
curtain
its
dark
cerise
background
spangled
as
if
with
stars
with
oversized
gold
pieces
there
was
a
prompter
s
box
and
there
was
even
an
audience
what
surprised
nikanor
ivanovich
was
that
this
audience
was
all
of
the
same
sex
male
and
all
for
some
reason
bearded
besides
that
it
was
striking
that
there
were
no
seats
in
the
theatre
and
the
audience
was
all
sitting
on
the
floor
splendidly
polished
and
slippery
abashed
in
this
new
and
big
company
nikanor
ivanovich
after
a
brief
hesitation
followed
the
general
example
and
sat
down
on
the
parquet
turkishfashion
huddled
between
some
stalwart
bearded
redhead
and
another
citizen
pale
and
quite
overgrown
none
of
the
sitters
paid
any
attention
to
the
newly
arrived
spectator
here
the
soft
ringing
of
a
bell
was
heard
the
lights
in
the
house
went
out
and
the
curtain
opened
to
reveal
a
lighted
stage
with
an
armchair
a
little
table
on
which
stood
a
golden
bell
and
a
solid
black
velvet
backdrop
an
artiste
came
out
from
the
wings
in
an
evening
jacket
smoothly
shaven
his
hair
neatly
parted
young
and
with
very
pleasant
features
the
audience
in
the
house
livened
up
and
everyone
turned
towards
the
stage
the
artiste
advanced
to
the
prompter
s
box
and
rubbed
his
hands
all
sitting
he
asked
in
a
soft
baritone
and
smiled
to
the
house
sitting
sitting
a
chorus
of
tenors
and
basses
answered
from
the
house
hm
the
artiste
began
pensively
and
how
you
re
not
sick
of
it
i
just
don
t
understand
everybody
else
is
out
walking
around
now
enjoying
the
spring
sun
and
the
warmth
and
you
re
stuck
in
here
on
the
floor
of
a
stuffy
theatre
is
the
programme
so
interesting
tastes
differ
however
the
artiste
concluded
philosophically
then
he
changed
both
the
timbre
of
his
voice
and
its
intonation
and
announced
gaily
and
resoundingly
and
now
for
the
next
number
on
our
programme
nikanor
ivanovich
bosoy
chairman
of
a
house
committee
and
director
of
a
dietetic
kitchen
nikanor
ivanovich
onstage
general
applause
greeted
the
artiste
the
surprised
nikanor
ivanovich
goggled
his
eyes
while
the
master
of
ceremonies
blocking
the
glare
of
the
footlights
with
his
hand
located
him
among
the
sitters
and
tenderly
beckoned
him
onstage
with
his
finger
and
nikanor
ivanovich
without
knowing
how
found
himself
onstage
beams
of
coloured
light
struck
his
eyes
from
in
front
and
below
which
at
once
caused
the
house
and
the
audience
to
sink
into
darkness
well
nikanor
ivanovich
set
us
a
good
example
sir
the
young
artiste
said
soulfully
turn
over
your
currency
silence
ensued
nikanor
ivanovich
took
a
deep
breath
and
quietly
began
to
speak
i
swear
to
god
that
i
but
before
he
had
time
to
get
the
words
out
the
whole
house
burst
into
shouts
of
indignation
nikanor
ivanovich
got
confused
and
fell
silent
as
far
as
i
understand
you
said
the
programme
announcer
you
wanted
to
swear
to
god
that
you
haven
t
got
any
currency
and
he
gazed
sympathetically
at
nikanor
ivanovich
exactly
right
i
haven
t
replied
nikanor
ivanovich
right
responded
the
artiste
and
excuse
the
indiscretion
where
did
the
four
hundred
dollars
that
were
found
in
the
privy
of
the
apartment
of
which
you
and
your
wife
are
the
sole
inhabitants
come
from
magic
someone
in
the
dark
house
said
with
obvious
irony
exactly
right
magic
nikanor
ivanovich
timidly
replied
vaguely
addressing
either
the
artiste
or
the
dark
house
and
he
explained
unclean
powers
the
checkered
interpreter
stuck
me
with
them
and
again
the
house
raised
an
indignant
roar
when
silence
came
the
artiste
said
see
what
la
fontaine
fables
i
have
to
listen
to
stuck
him
with
four
hundred
dollars
now
all
of
you
here
are
currency
dealers
so
i
address
you
as
experts
is
that
conceivable
we
re
not
currency
dealers
various
offended
voices
came
from
the
theatre
but
no
it
s
not
conceivable
i
m
entirely
of
the
same
mind
the
artiste
said
firmly
and
let
me
ask
you
what
is
it
that
one
can
be
stuck
with
a
baby
someone
cried
from
the
house
absolutely
correct
the
programme
announcer
confirmed
a
baby
an
anonymous
letter
a
tract
an
infernal
machine
anything
else
but
no
one
will
stick
you
with
four
hundred
dollars
for
such
idiots
don
t
exist
in
nature
and
turning
to
nikanor
ivanovich
the
artiste
added
reproachfully
and
sorrowfully
you
ve
upset
me
nikanor
ivanovich
and
i
was
counting
on
you
so
our
number
didn
t
come
off
whistles
came
from
the
house
addressed
to
nikanor
ivanovich
he
s
a
currency
dealer
they
shouted
from
the
house
and
we
innocent
ones
have
to
suffer
for
the
likes
of
him
don
t
scold
him
the
master
of
ceremonies
said
softly
he
ll
repent
and
turning
to
nikanor
ivanovich
his
blue
eyes
filled
with
tears
he
added
well
nikanor
ivanovich
you
may
go
to
your
place
after
that
the
artiste
rang
the
bell
and
announced
loudly
intermission
you
blackguards
the
shaken
nikanor
ivanovich
who
unexpectedly
for
himself
had
become
a
participant
in
some
sort
of
theatre
programme
again
found
himself
in
his
place
on
the
floor
here
he
dreamed
that
the
house
was
plunged
in
total
darkness
and
fiery
red
words
leaped
out
on
the
walls
turn
over
your
currency
then
the
curtain
opened
again
and
the
master
of
ceremonies
invited
i
call
sergei
gerardovich
dunchil
to
the
stage
dunchil
turned
out
to
be
a
finelooking
but
rather
unkempt
man
of
about
fifty
sergei
gerardovich
the
master
of
ceremonies
addressed
him
you
ve
been
sitting
here
for
a
month
and
a
half
now
stubbornly
refusing
to
turn
over
the
currency
you
still
have
while
the
country
is
in
need
of
it
and
you
have
no
use
for
it
whatsoever
and
still
you
persist
you
re
an
intelligent
man
you
understand
it
all
perfectly
well
and
yet
you
don
t
want
to
comply
with
me
to
my
regret
there
is
nothing
i
can
do
since
i
have
no
more
currency
dunchil
calmly
replied
don
t
you
at
least
have
some
diamonds
asked
the
artiste
no
diamonds
either
the
artiste
hung
his
head
and
pondered
then
clapped
his
hands
a
middleaged
lady
came
out
from
the
wings
fashionably
dressed
that
is
in
a
collarless
coat
and
a
tiny
hat
the
lady
looked
worried
but
dunchil
glanced
at
her
without
moving
an
eyebrow
who
is
this
lady
the
programme
announcer
asked
dunchil
that
is
my
wife
dunchil
replied
with
dignity
and
looked
at
the
lady
s
long
neck
with
a
certain
repugnance
we
have
troubled
you
madame
dunchil
the
master
of
ceremonies
adverted
to
the
lady
with
regard
to
the
following
we
wanted
to
ask
you
does
your
husband
have
any
more
currency
he
turned
it
all
over
the
other
time
madame
dunchil
replied
nervously
right
said
the
artiste
well
then
if
it
s
so
it
s
so
if
he
turned
it
all
over
then
we
ought
to
part
with
sergei
gerardovich
immediately
there
s
nothing
else
to
do
if
you
wish
sergei
gerardovich
you
may
leave
the
theatre
and
the
artiste
made
a
regal
gesture
dunchil
turned
calmly
and
with
dignity
and
headed
for
the
wings
just
a
moment
the
master
of
ceremonies
stopped
him
allow
me
on
parting
to
show
you
one
more
number
from
our
programme
and
again
he
clapped
his
hands
the
black
backdrop
parted
and
on
to
the
stage
came
a
young
beauty
in
a
ball
gown
holding
in
her
hands
a
golden
tray
on
which
lay
a
fat
wad
tied
with
candybox
ribbon
and
a
diamond
necklace
from
which
blue
yellow
and
red
fire
leaped
in
all
directions
dunchil
took
a
step
back
and
his
face
went
pale
the
house
froze
eighteen
thousand
dollars
and
a
necklace
worth
forty
thousand
in
gold
the
artiste
solemnly
announced
kept
by
sergei
gerardovich
in
the
city
of
kharkov
in
the
apartment
of
his
mistress
ida
herkulanovna
vors
whom
we
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
here
before
us
and
who
so
kindly
helped
in
discovering
these
treasures
priceless
yet
useless
in
the
hands
of
a
private
person
many
thanks
ida
herkulanovna
the
beauty
smiled
flashing
her
teeth
and
her
lush
eyelashes
fluttered
and
under
your
so
very
dignified
mask
the
artiste
adverted
to
dunchil
is
concealed
a
greedy
spider
and
an
astonishing
bamboozler
and
liar
you
wore
everyone
out
during
this
month
and
a
half
with
your
dull
obstinacy
go
home
now
and
let
the
hell
your
wife
sets
up
for
you
be
your
punishment
dunchil
swayed
and
it
seems
wanted
to
fall
down
but
was
held
up
by
someone
s
sympathetic
hands
here
the
front
curtain
dropped
and
concealed
all
those
onstage
furious
applause
shook
the
house
so
much
so
that
nikanor
ivanovich
fancied
the
lights
were
leaping
in
the
chandeliers
when
the
front
curtain
went
up
there
was
no
one
onstage
except
the
lone
artiste
greeted
with
a
second
burst
of
applause
he
bowed
and
began
to
speak
in
the
person
of
this
dunchil
our
programme
has
shown
you
a
typical
ass
i
did
have
the
pleasure
of
saying
yesterday
that
the
concealing
of
currency
is
senseless
no
one
can
make
use
of
it
under
any
circumstances
i
assure
you
let
s
take
this
same
dunchil
he
gets
a
splendid
salary
and
doesn
t
want
for
anything
he
has
a
splendid
apartment
a
wife
and
a
beautiful
mistress
but
no
instead
of
living
quietly
and
peacefully
without
any
troubles
having
turned
over
the
currency
and
stones
this
mercenary
blockhead
gets
himself
exposed
in
front
of
everybody
and
to
top
it
off
contracts
major
family
trouble
so
who
s
going
to
turn
over
any
volunteers
in
that
case
for
the
next
number
on
our
programme
a
famous
dramatic
talent
the
actor
kurolesov
savva
potapovich
especially
invited
here
will
perform
excerpts
fromthe
covetous
knight
by
the
poet
pushkin
the
promised
kurolesov
was
not
slow
in
coming
on
stage
and
turned
out
to
be
a
strapping
and
beefy
man
cleanshaven
in
a
tailcoat
and
white
tie
without
any
preliminaries
he
concocted
a
gloomy
face
knitted
his
brows
and
began
speaking
in
an
unnatural
voice
glancing
sidelong
at
the
golden
bell
as
a
young
scapegrace
awaits
a
tryst
with
some
sly
strumpet
and
kurolesov
told
many
bad
things
about
himself
nikanor
ivanovich
heard
kurolesov
confess
that
some
wretched
widow
had
gone
on
her
knees
to
him
howling
in
the
rain
but
had
failed
to
move
the
actor
s
callous
heart
before
his
dream
nikanor
ivanovich
had
been
completely
ignorant
of
the
poet
pushkin
s
works
but
the
man
himself
he
knew
perfectly
well
and
several
times
a
day
used
to
say
phrases
like
and
who
s
going
to
pay
the
rent
pushkin
or
then
who
did
unscrew
the
bulb
on
the
stairway
pushkin
or
so
who
s
going
to
buy
the
fuel
pushkin
now
having
become
acquainted
with
one
of
his
works
nikanor
ivanovich
felt
sad
imagined
the
woman
on
her
knees
with
her
orphaned
children
in
the
rain
and
involuntarily
thought
what
a
type
though
this
kurolesov
and
the
latter
ever
raising
his
voice
went
on
with
his
confession
and
got
nikanor
ivanovich
definitively
muddled
because
he
suddenly
started
addressing
someone
who
was
not
onstage
and
responded
for
this
absent
one
himself
calling
himself
now
dear
sir
now
baron
now
father
now
son
now
formally
and
now
familiarly
nikanor
ivanovich
understood
only
one
thing
that
the
actor
died
an
evil
death
crying
out
keys
my
keys
after
which
he
collapsed
on
the
floor
gasping
and
carefully
tearing
off
his
tie
having
died
kurolesov
got
up
brushed
the
dust
from
his
trousers
bowed
with
a
false
smile
and
withdrew
to
the
accompaniment
of
thin
applause
and
the
master
of
ceremonies
began
speaking
thus
we
have
just
heardthe
covetous
knight
wonderfully
performed
by
savva
potapovich
this
knight
hoped
that
frolicking
nymphs
would
come
running
to
him
and
that
many
other
pleasant
things
in
the
same
vein
would
occur
but
as
you
see
none
of
it
happened
no
nymphs
came
running
to
him
and
the
muses
paid
him
no
tribute
and
he
raised
no
mansions
but
on
the
contrary
ended
quite
badly
died
of
a
stroke
devil
take
him
on
his
chest
of
currency
and
jewels
i
warn
you
that
the
same
sort
of
thing
if
not
worse
is
going
to
happen
to
you
if
you
don
t
turn
over
your
currency
whether
pushkin
s
poetry
produced
such
an
effect
or
it
was
the
prosaic
speech
of
the
master
of
ceremonies
in
any
case
a
shy
voice
suddenly
came
from
the
house
i
ll
turn
over
my
currency
kindly
come
to
the
stage
the
master
of
ceremonies
courteously
invited
peering
into
the
dark
house
onstage
appeared
a
short
fairhaired
citizen
who
judging
by
his
face
had
not
shaved
in
about
three
weeks
beg
pardon
what
is
your
name
the
master
of
ceremonies
inquired
kanavkin
nikolai
the
man
responded
shyly
ah
very
pleased
citizen
kanavkin
and
so
i
ll
turn
it
over
kanavkin
said
quietly
how
much
a
thousand
dollars
and
twenty
tenrouble
gold
pieces
bravo
that
s
all
then
the
programme
announcer
stared
straight
into
kanavkin
s
eyes
and
it
even
seemed
to
nikanor
ivanovich
that
those
eyes
sent
out
rays
that
penetrated
kanavkin
like
xrays
the
house
stopped
breathing
i
believe
you
the
artiste
exclaimed
finally
and
extinguished
his
gaze
i
do
these
eyes
are
not
lying
how
many
times
have
i
told
you
that
your
basic
error
consists
in
underestimating
the
significance
of
the
human
eye
understand
that
the
tongue
can
conceal
the
truth
but
the
eyes
never
a
sudden
question
is
put
to
you
you
don
t
even
flinch
in
one
second
you
get
hold
of
yourself
and
know
what
you
must
say
to
conceal
the
truth
and
you
speak
quite
convincingly
and
not
a
wrinkle
on
your
face
moves
but
alas
the
truth
which
the
question
stirs
up
from
the
bottom
of
your
soul
leaps
momentarily
into
your
eyes
and
it
s
all
over
they
see
it
and
you
re
caught
having
delivered
and
with
great
ardour
this
highly
convincing
speech
the
artiste
tenderly
inquired
of
kanavkin
and
where
is
it
hidden
with
my
aunt
porokhovnikova
on
prechistenka
ah
that
s
wait
that
s
klavdia
ilyinishna
isn
t
it
yes
ah
yes
yes
yes
yes
a
separate
little
house
a
little
front
garden
opposite
of
course
i
know
i
know
and
where
did
you
put
it
there
in
the
cellar
in
a
candy
tin
the
artiste
clasped
his
hands
have
you
ever
seen
the
like
he
cried
out
chagrined
why
it
ll
get
damp
and
mouldy
there
is
it
conceivable
to
entrust
currency
to
such
people
eh
sheer
childishness
by
god
kanavkin
himself
realized
he
had
fouled
up
and
was
in
for
it
and
he
hung
his
tufty
head
money
the
artiste
went
on
must
be
kept
in
the
state
bank
in
special
dry
and
wellguarded
rooms
and
by
no
means
in
some
aunt
s
cellar
where
it
may
in
particular
suffer
damage
from
rats
really
kanavkin
for
shame
you
re
a
grownup
kanavkin
no
longer
knew
what
to
do
with
himself
and
merely
picked
at
the
lapel
of
his
jacket
with
his
finger
well
all
right
the
artiste
relented
let
bygones
be
and
he
suddenly
added
unexpectedly
ah
by
the
way
so
that
in
one
to
save
a
trip
this
same
aunt
also
has
some
eh
kanavkin
never
expecting
such
a
turn
of
affairs
wavered
and
the
theatre
fell
silent
ehh
kanavkin
the
master
of
ceremonies
said
in
tender
reproach
and
here
i
was
praising
him
look
he
just
went
and
messed
it
up
for
no
reason
at
all
it
s
absurd
kanavkin
wasn
t
i
just
talking
about
eyes
can
t
we
see
that
the
aunt
has
got
some
well
then
why
do
you
torment
us
for
nothing
she
has
kanavkin
cried
dashingly
bravo
cried
the
master
of
ceremonies
bravo
the
house
roared
frightfully
when
things
quieted
down
the
master
of
ceremonies
congratulated
kanavkin
shook
his
hand
offered
him
a
ride
home
to
the
city
in
a
car
and
told
someone
in
the
wings
to
go
in
that
same
car
to
fetch
the
aunt
and
ask
her
kindly
to
come
for
the
programme
at
the
women
s
theatre
ah
yes
i
wanted
to
ask
you
has
the
aunt
ever
mentioned
where
she
hides
hers
the
master
of
ceremonies
inquired
courteously
offering
kanavkin
a
cigarette
and
a
lighted
match
as
he
lit
up
the
man
grinned
somehow
wistfully
i
believe
you
i
believe
you
the
artiste
responded
with
a
sigh
not
just
her
nephew
the
old
pinchfist
wouldn
t
tell
the
devil
himself
well
so
we
ll
try
to
awaken
some
human
feelings
in
her
maybe
not
all
the
strings
have
rotted
in
her
usurious
little
soul
byebye
kanavkin
and
the
happy
kanavkin
drove
off
the
artiste
inquired
whether
there
were
any
others
who
wished
to
turn
over
their
currency
but
was
answered
with
silence
odd
birds
by
god
the
artiste
said
shrugging
and
the
curtain
hid
him
the
lights
went
out
there
was
darkness
for
a
while
and
in
it
a
nervous
tenor
was
heard
singing
from
far
away
there
great
heaps
of
gold
do
shine
and
all
those
heaps
of
gold
are
mine
then
twice
the
sound
of
subdued
applause
came
from
somewhere
some
little
lady
in
the
women
s
theatre
is
turning
hers
over
nikanor
ivanovich
s
redbearded
neighbour
spoke
up
unexpectedly
and
added
with
a
sigh
ah
if
it
wasn
t
for
my
geese
i
ve
got
fighting
geese
in
lianozovo
my
dear
fellow
they
ll
die
without
me
i
m
afraid
a
fighting
bird
s
delicate
it
needs
care
ah
if
it
wasn
t
for
my
geese
they
won
t
surprise
me
with
pushkin
and
again
he
began
to
sigh
here
the
house
lit
up
brightly
and
nikanor
ivanovich
dreamed
that
cooks
in
white
chef
s
hats
and
with
ladles
in
their
hands
came
pouring
from
all
the
doors
scullions
dragged
in
a
cauldron
of
soup
and
a
stand
with
cutup
rye
bread
the
spectators
livened
up
the
jolly
cooks
shuttled
among
the
theatre
buffs
ladled
out
bowls
of
soup
and
distributed
bread
dig
in
lads
the
cooks
shouted
and
turn
over
your
currency
what
s
the
point
of
sitting
here
who
wants
to
slop
up
this
swill
go
home
have
a
good
drink
a
little
bite
that
s
the
way
now
you
for
instance
what
re
you
doing
sitting
here
old
man
nikanor
ivanovich
was
directly
addressed
by
a
fat
cook
with
a
raspberrycoloured
neck
as
he
offered
him
a
bowl
in
which
a
lone
cabbage
leaf
floated
in
some
liquid
i
don
t
have
any
i
don
t
i
don
t
nikanor
ivanovich
cried
out
in
a
terrible
voice
you
understand
i
don
t
you
don
t
the
cook
bellowed
in
a
menacing
bass
you
don
t
he
asked
in
a
tender
woman
s
voice
you
don
t
you
don
t
he
murmured
soothingly
turning
into
the
nurse
praskovya
fyodorovna
she
was
gently
shaking
nikanor
ivanovich
by
the
shoulder
as
he
moaned
in
his
sleep
then
the
cooks
melted
away
and
the
theatre
with
its
curtain
broke
up
through
his
tears
nikanor
ivanovich
made
out
his
room
in
the
hospital
and
two
people
in
white
coats
who
were
by
no
means
casual
cooks
getting
at
people
with
their
advice
but
the
doctor
and
that
same
praskovya
fyodorovna
who
was
holding
not
a
bowl
but
a
little
dish
covered
with
gauze
with
a
syringe
lying
on
it
what
is
all
this
nikanor
ivanovich
said
bitterly
as
they
were
giving
him
the
injection
i
don
t
have
any
and
that
s
that
let
pushkin
turn
over
his
currency
for
them
i
don
t
have
any
no
you
don
t
you
don
t
the
kindhearted
praskovya
fyodorovna
soothed
him
and
if
you
don
t
there
s
no
more
to
be
said
after
the
injection
nikanor
ivanovich
felt
better
and
fell
asleep
without
any
dreams
but
thanks
to
his
cries
alarm
was
communicated
to
room
where
the
patient
woke
up
and
began
looking
for
his
head
and
to
room
where
the
unknown
master
became
restless
and
wrung
his
hands
in
anguish
looking
at
the
moon
remembering
the
last
bitter
autumn
night
of
his
life
a
strip
of
light
under
the
basement
door
and
uncurled
hair
from
room
the
alarm
flew
by
way
of
the
balcony
to
ivan
and
he
woke
up
and
began
to
weep
but
the
doctor
quickly
calmed
all
these
anxious
sorrowing
heads
and
they
began
to
fall
asleep
ivan
was
the
last
to
become
oblivious
as
dawn
was
already
breaking
over
the
river
after
the
medicine
which
suffused
his
whole
body
calm
came
like
a
wave
and
covered
him
his
body
grew
lighter
his
head
basked
in
the
warm
wind
of
reverie
he
fell
asleep
and
the
last
waking
thing
he
heard
was
the
predawn
chirping
of
birds
in
the
woods
but
they
soon
fell
silent
and
he
began
dreaming
that
the
sun
was
already
going
down
over
bald
mountain
and
the
mountain
was
cordoned
off
by
a
double
cordon
chapter
the
execution
the
sun
was
already
going
down
over
bald
mountain
and
the
mountain
was
cordoned
off
by
a
double
cordon
the
cavalry
ala
that
had
cut
across
the
procurator
s
path
around
noon
came
trotting
up
to
the
hebron
gate
of
the
city
its
way
had
already
been
prepared
the
infantry
of
the
cappadocian
cohort
had
pushed
the
conglomeration
of
people
mules
and
camels
to
the
sides
and
the
ala
trotting
and
raising
white
columns
of
dust
in
the
sky
came
to
an
intersection
where
two
roads
met
the
south
road
leading
to
bethlehem
and
the
northwest
road
to
jaffa
the
ala
raced
down
the
northwest
road
the
same
cappadocians
were
strung
out
along
the
sides
of
the
road
and
in
good
time
had
driven
to
the
sides
of
it
all
the
caravans
hastening
to
the
feast
in
yershalaim
crowds
of
pilgrims
stood
behind
the
cappadocians
having
abandoned
their
temporary
striped
tents
pitched
right
on
the
grass
going
on
for
about
a
halfmile
the
ala
caught
up
with
the
second
cohort
of
the
lightning
legion
and
having
covered
another
halfmile
was
the
first
to
reach
the
foot
of
bald
mountain
here
they
dismounted
the
commander
broke
the
ala
up
into
squads
and
they
cordoned
off
the
whole
foot
of
the
small
hill
leaving
open
only
the
way
up
from
the
jaffa
road
after
some
time
the
ala
was
joined
at
the
hill
by
the
second
cohort
which
climbed
one
level
higher
and
also
encircled
the
hill
in
a
wreath
finally
the
century
under
the
command
of
mark
ratslayer
arrived
it
went
stretched
out
in
files
along
the
sides
of
the
road
and
between
these
files
convoyed
by
the
secret
guard
the
three
condemned
men
rode
in
a
cart
white
boards
hanging
around
their
necks
with
robber
and
rebel
written
on
each
of
them
in
two
languages
aramaic
and
greek
the
cart
with
the
condemned
men
was
followed
by
others
laden
with
freshly
hewn
posts
with
crosspieces
ropes
shovels
buckets
and
axes
six
executioners
rode
in
these
carts
they
were
followed
on
horseback
by
the
centurion
mark
the
chief
of
the
temple
guard
of
yershalaim
and
that
same
hooded
man
with
whom
pilate
had
had
a
momentary
meeting
in
a
darkened
room
of
the
palace
a
file
of
soldiers
brought
up
the
rear
of
the
procession
and
behind
it
walked
about
two
thousand
of
the
curious
undaunted
by
the
infernal
heat
and
wishing
to
be
present
at
the
interesting
spectacle
the
curious
from
the
city
were
now
joined
by
the
curious
from
among
the
pilgrims
who
were
admitted
without
hindrance
to
the
tail
of
the
procession
under
the
shrill
cries
of
the
heralds
who
accompanied
the
column
and
cried
aloud
what
pilate
had
cried
out
at
around
noon
the
procession
drew
itself
up
bald
mountain
the
ala
admitted
everyone
to
the
second
level
but
the
second
century
let
only
those
connected
with
the
execution
go
further
up
and
then
manoeuvring
quickly
spread
the
crowd
around
the
entire
hill
so
that
people
found
themselves
between
the
cordons
of
infantry
above
and
cavalry
below
now
they
could
watch
the
execution
through
the
sparse
line
of
the
infantry
and
so
more
than
three
hours
had
gone
by
since
the
procession
climbed
the
mountain
and
the
sun
was
already
going
down
over
bald
mountain
but
the
heat
was
still
unbearable
and
the
soldiers
in
both
cordons
suffered
from
it
grew
weary
with
boredom
and
cursed
the
three
robbers
in
their
hearts
sincerely
wishing
them
the
speediest
death
the
little
commander
of
the
ala
his
brow
moist
and
the
back
of
his
white
shirt
dark
with
sweat
having
placed
himself
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
by
the
open
passage
went
over
to
the
leather
bucket
of
the
first
squad
every
now
and
then
scooped
handfuls
of
water
from
it
drank
and
wetted
his
turban
somewhat
relieved
by
that
he
would
step
away
and
again
begin
pacing
back
and
forth
on
the
dusty
road
leading
to
the
top
his
long
sword
slapped
against
his
laced
leather
boot
the
commander
wished
to
give
his
cavalrymen
an
example
of
endurance
but
pitying
his
soldiers
he
allowed
them
to
stick
their
spears
pyramidlike
in
the
ground
and
throw
their
white
cloaks
over
them
under
these
tents
the
syrians
hid
from
the
merciless
sun
the
buckets
were
quickly
emptied
and
cavalrymen
from
different
squads
took
turns
going
to
fetch
water
in
the
gully
below
the
hill
where
in
the
thin
shade
of
spindly
mulberries
a
muddy
brook
was
living
out
its
last
days
in
the
devilish
heat
there
too
catching
the
unsteady
shade
stood
the
bored
horsehandlers
holding
the
quieted
horses
the
weariness
of
the
soldiers
and
the
abuse
they
aimed
at
the
robbers
were
understandable
the
procurator
s
apprehensions
concerning
the
disorders
that
might
occur
at
the
time
of
the
execution
in
the
city
of
yershalaim
so
hated
by
him
fortunately
were
not
borne
out
and
when
the
fourth
hour
of
the
execution
came
there
was
contrary
to
all
expectations
not
a
single
person
left
between
the
two
files
the
infantry
above
and
the
cavalry
below
the
sun
had
scorched
the
crowd
and
driven
it
back
to
yershalaim
beyond
the
file
of
two
roman
centuries
there
were
only
two
dogs
that
belonged
to
no
one
knew
whom
and
had
for
some
reason
ended
up
on
the
hill
but
the
heat
got
to
them
too
and
they
lay
down
with
their
tongues
hanging
out
panting
and
paying
no
attention
to
the
greenbacked
lizards
the
only
beings
not
afraid
of
the
sun
darting
among
the
scorching
stones
and
some
sort
of
bigthorned
plants
that
crept
on
the
ground
no
one
attempted
to
rescue
the
condemned
men
either
in
yershalaim
itself
flooded
with
troops
or
here
on
the
cordonedoff
hill
and
the
crowd
went
back
to
the
city
for
indeed
there
was
absolutely
nothing
interesting
in
this
execution
while
there
in
the
city
preparations
were
under
way
for
the
great
feast
of
passover
which
was
to
begin
that
evening
the
roman
infantry
on
the
second
level
suffered
still
more
than
the
cavalry
the
only
thing
the
centurion
ratslayer
allowed
his
soldiers
was
to
take
off
their
helmets
and
cover
their
heads
with
white
headbands
dipped
in
water
but
he
kept
them
standing
and
with
their
spears
in
their
hands
he
himself
in
the
same
kind
of
headband
but
dry
not
wet
walked
about
not
far
from
the
group
of
executioners
without
even
taking
the
silver
plaques
with
lions
muzzles
off
his
shirt
or
removing
his
greaves
sword
and
knife
the
sun
beat
straight
down
on
the
centurion
without
doing
him
any
harm
and
the
lions
muzzles
were
impossible
to
look
at
the
eyes
were
devoured
by
the
dazzling
gleam
of
the
silver
which
was
as
if
boiling
in
the
sun
ratslayer
s
mutilated
face
expressed
neither
weariness
nor
displeasure
and
it
seemed
that
the
giant
centurion
was
capable
of
pacing
like
that
all
day
all
night
and
the
next
day
in
short
for
as
long
as
necessary
of
pacing
in
the
same
way
holding
his
hands
to
the
heavy
belt
with
its
bronze
plaques
glancing
in
the
same
stem
way
now
at
the
posts
with
the
executed
men
now
at
the
file
of
soldiers
kicking
aside
with
the
toe
of
a
shaggy
boot
in
the
same
indifferent
way
human
bones
whitened
by
time
or
small
flints
that
happened
under
his
feet
that
man
in
the
hood
placed
himself
not
far
from
the
posts
on
a
threelegged
stool
and
sat
there
in
complacent
motionlessness
though
poking
the
sand
with
a
twig
from
time
to
time
out
of
boredom
what
has
been
said
about
there
not
being
a
single
person
beyond
the
file
of
legionaries
is
not
quite
true
there
was
one
person
but
he
simply
could
not
be
seen
by
everyone
he
had
placed
himself
not
on
the
side
where
the
way
up
the
mountain
was
open
and
from
where
it
would
have
been
most
convenient
to
watch
the
execution
but
on
the
north
side
where
the
slope
was
not
gentle
and
accessible
but
uneven
with
gaps
and
clefts
where
in
a
crevice
clutching
at
the
heavencursed
waterless
soil
a
sickly
fig
tree
was
trying
to
live
precisely
under
it
though
it
gave
no
shade
this
sole
spectator
who
was
not
a
participant
in
the
execution
had
established
himself
and
had
sat
on
a
stone
from
the
very
beginning
that
is
for
over
three
hours
now
yes
he
had
chosen
not
the
best
but
the
worst
position
for
watching
the
execution
but
still
even
from
there
the
posts
could
be
seen
and
there
could
also
be
seen
beyond
the
file
of
soldiers
the
two
dazzling
spots
on
the
centurion
s
chest
and
that
was
apparently
quite
enough
for
a
man
who
obviously
wished
to
remain
little
noticed
and
not
be
bothered
by
anyone
but
some
four
hours
ago
at
the
start
of
the
execution
this
man
had
behaved
quite
differently
and
might
have
been
noticed
very
well
which
was
probably
why
he
had
now
changed
his
behaviour
and
secluded
himself
it
was
only
when
the
procession
came
to
the
very
top
beyond
the
file
that
he
had
first
appeared
and
as
an
obvious
latecomer
at
that
he
was
breathing
hard
and
did
not
walk
but
ran
up
the
hill
pushing
his
way
and
seeing
the
file
close
together
before
him
as
before
everyone
else
made
a
naive
attempt
pretending
he
did
not
understand
the
angry
shouts
to
break
through
the
soldiers
to
the
very
place
of
execution
where
the
condemned
men
were
already
being
taken
from
the
cart
for
that
he
received
a
heavy
blow
in
the
chest
with
the
butt
end
of
a
spear
and
he
leaped
back
from
the
soldiers
crying
out
not
in
pain
but
in
despair
at
the
legionary
who
had
dealt
the
blow
he
cast
a
dull
glance
utterly
indifferent
to
everything
like
a
man
insensible
to
physical
pain
coughing
and
breathless
clutching
his
chest
he
ran
around
the
hill
trying
to
find
some
gap
in
the
file
on
the
north
side
where
he
could
slip
through
but
it
was
too
late
the
ring
was
closed
and
the
man
his
face
distorted
with
grief
was
forced
to
renounce
his
attempts
to
break
through
to
the
carts
from
which
the
posts
had
already
been
unloaded
these
attempts
would
have
led
nowhere
except
that
he
would
have
been
seized
and
to
be
arrested
on
that
day
by
no
means
entered
his
plans
and
so
he
went
to
the
side
towards
the
crevice
where
it
was
quieter
and
nobody
bothered
him
now
sitting
on
the
stone
this
blackbearded
man
his
eyes
festering
from
the
sun
and
lack
of
sleep
was
in
anguish
first
he
sighed
opening
his
tallith
worn
out
in
his
wanderings
gone
from
lightblue
to
dirty
grey
and
bared
his
chest
which
had
been
hurt
by
the
spear
and
down
which
ran
dirty
sweat
then
in
unendurable
pain
he
raised
his
eyes
to
the
sky
following
the
three
vultures
that
had
long
been
floating
in
great
circles
on
high
anticipating
an
imminent
feast
then
he
peered
with
hopeless
eyes
into
the
yellow
earth
and
saw
on
it
the
halfdestroyed
skull
of
a
dog
and
lizards
scurrying
around
it
the
man
s
sufferings
were
so
great
that
at
times
he
began
talking
to
himself
oh
fool
that
i
am
he
muttered
swaying
on
the
stone
in
the
pain
of
his
heart
and
clawing
his
swarthy
chest
with
his
nails
fool
senseless
woman
coward
i
m
not
a
man
i
m
carrion
he
would
fall
silent
hang
his
head
then
after
drinking
some
warm
water
from
a
wooden
flask
he
would
revive
again
and
clutch
now
at
the
knife
hidden
on
his
chest
under
the
tallith
now
at
the
piece
of
parchment
lying
before
him
on
the
stone
next
to
a
stylus
and
a
pot
of
ink
on
this
parchment
some
notes
had
already
been
scribbled
the
minutes
run
on
and
i
matthew
levi
am
here
on
bald
mountain
and
still
no
death
further
the
sun
is
sinking
but
no
death
now
matthew
levi
wrote
hopelessly
with
the
sharp
stylus
god
why
are
you
angry
with
him
send
him
death
having
written
this
he
sobbed
tearlessly
and
again
wounded
his
chest
with
his
nails
the
reason
for
levi
s
despair
lay
in
the
terrible
misfortune
that
had
befallen
yeshua
and
him
and
besides
that
in
the
grave
error
that
he
levi
in
his
own
opinion
had
committed
two
days
earlier
yeshua
and
levi
had
been
in
bethphage
near
yershalaim
where
they
had
visited
a
certain
gardener
who
liked
yeshua
s
preaching
very
much
the
two
visitors
had
spent
the
whole
morning
working
in
the
garden
helping
their
host
and
planned
to
go
to
yershalaim
towards
evening
when
it
cooled
off
but
yeshua
began
to
hurry
for
some
reason
said
he
had
urgent
business
in
the
city
and
left
alone
around
noontime
here
lay
matthew
levi
s
first
error
why
why
had
he
let
him
go
alone
nor
was
matthew
levi
to
go
to
yershalaim
that
evening
he
was
struck
by
some
unexpected
and
terrible
ailment
he
began
to
shake
his
whole
body
was
filled
with
fire
his
teeth
chattered
and
he
kept
asking
to
drink
all
the
time
he
could
not
go
anywhere
he
collapsed
on
a
horse
blanket
in
the
gardener
s
shed
and
lay
there
till
dawn
on
friday
when
the
illness
released
levi
as
unexpectedly
as
it
had
fallen
upon
him
though
he
was
still
weak
and
his
legs
trembled
he
took
leave
of
his
host
and
oppressed
by
some
foreboding
of
disaster
went
to
yershalaim
there
he
learned
that
his
foreboding
had
not
deceived
him
the
disaster
occurred
levi
was
in
the
crowd
and
heard
the
procurator
announce
the
sentence
when
the
condemned
men
were
led
off
to
the
mountain
matthew
levi
ran
alongside
the
file
in
the
crowd
of
the
curious
trying
to
let
yeshua
know
in
some
inconspicuous
way
that
at
least
he
levi
was
there
with
him
that
he
had
not
abandoned
him
on
his
last
journey
and
that
he
was
praying
that
death
would
overtake
yeshua
as
soon
as
possible
but
yeshua
who
was
looking
into
the
distance
towards
where
he
was
being
taken
of
course
did
not
see
levi
and
then
when
the
procession
had
gone
about
a
halfmile
along
the
road
a
simple
and
ingenious
thought
dawned
on
matthew
who
was
being
jostled
by
the
crowd
just
next
to
the
file
and
in
his
excitement
he
at
once
showered
himself
with
curses
for
not
having
thought
of
it
earlier
the
file
of
soldiers
was
not
solid
there
were
spaces
between
them
given
great
dexterity
and
a
precise
calculation
one
could
bend
down
slip
between
two
legionaries
make
it
to
the
cart
and
jump
into
it
then
yeshua
would
be
saved
from
suffering
one
instant
would
be
enough
to
stab
yeshua
in
the
back
with
a
knife
crying
to
him
yeshua
i
save
you
and
go
with
you
i
matthew
your
faithful
and
only
disciple
and
if
god
granted
him
one
more
free
instant
he
would
also
have
time
to
stab
himself
and
avoid
death
on
a
post
this
last
however
was
of
little
interest
to
levi
the
former
tax
collector
he
was
indifferent
to
how
he
died
he
wanted
one
thing
that
yeshua
who
had
never
in
his
life
done
the
least
evil
to
anyone
should
escape
torture
the
plan
was
a
very
good
one
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
was
that
levi
had
no
knife
with
him
nor
did
he
have
a
single
piece
of
money
furious
with
himself
levi
got
out
of
the
crowd
and
ran
back
to
the
city
a
single
feverish
thought
was
leaping
in
his
burning
head
how
to
procure
a
knife
there
in
the
city
in
any
way
possible
and
have
time
to
overtake
the
procession
he
ran
up
to
the
city
gate
manoeuvring
amid
the
throng
of
caravans
being
sucked
into
the
city
and
saw
to
his
left
the
open
door
of
a
little
shop
where
bread
was
sold
breathing
hard
after
running
down
the
scorched
road
levi
got
control
of
himself
entered
the
shop
very
sedately
greeted
the
woman
behind
the
counter
asked
her
to
take
the
top
loaf
from
the
shelf
which
for
some
reason
he
liked
better
than
the
others
and
when
she
turned
around
silently
and
quickly
took
from
the
counter
that
than
which
there
could
be
nothing
better
a
long
razorsharp
bread
knife
and
at
once
dashed
out
of
the
shop
a
few
moments
later
he
was
again
on
the
jaffa
road
but
the
procession
was
no
longer
in
sight
he
ran
at
times
he
had
to
drop
down
right
in
the
dust
and
lie
motionless
to
recover
his
breath
and
so
he
would
lie
there
to
the
astonishment
of
people
riding
on
mules
or
walking
on
foot
to
yershalaim
he
would
lie
listening
to
his
heart
pounding
not
only
in
his
chest
but
in
his
head
and
ears
having
recovered
his
breath
a
little
he
would
jump
up
and
continue
running
but
ever
slower
and
slower
when
he
finally
caught
sight
of
the
long
procession
raising
dust
in
the
distance
it
was
already
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
oh
god
levi
moaned
realizing
that
he
was
going
to
be
too
late
and
he
was
too
late
when
the
fourth
hour
of
the
execution
had
gone
by
levi
s
torments
reached
their
highest
degree
and
he
fell
into
a
rage
getting
up
from
the
stone
he
flung
to
the
ground
the
stolen
knife
stolen
in
vain
as
he
now
thought
crushed
the
flask
with
his
foot
depriving
himself
of
water
threw
off
his
kefia
seized
his
thin
hair
and
began
cursing
himself
he
cursed
himself
calling
out
meaningless
words
growled
and
spat
abused
his
father
and
mother
for
bringing
a
fool
into
the
world
seeing
that
curses
and
abuse
had
no
effect
and
nothing
in
the
sunscorched
place
was
changed
by
them
he
clenched
his
dry
fists
raised
them
squinting
to
the
sky
to
the
sun
that
was
sliding
ever
lower
lengthening
the
shadows
and
going
to
fall
into
the
mediterranean
and
demanded
an
immediate
miracle
from
god
he
demanded
that
god
at
once
send
yeshua
death
opening
his
eyes
he
became
convinced
that
everything
on
the
hill
was
unchanged
except
that
the
blazing
spots
on
the
centurion
s
chest
had
gone
out
the
sun
was
sending
its
rays
into
the
backs
of
the
executed
men
who
were
facing
yershalaim
then
levi
shouted
i
curse
you
god
in
a
rasping
voice
he
shouted
that
he
was
convinced
of
god
s
injustice
and
did
not
intend
to
believe
in
him
any
longer
you
are
deaf
growled
levi
if
you
were
not
deaf
you
would
have
heard
me
and
killed
him
straight
away
shutting
his
eyes
levi
waited
for
the
fire
that
would
fall
from
the
sky
and
strike
him
instead
this
did
not
happen
and
levi
without
opening
his
eyes
went
on
shouting
offensive
and
sarcastic
things
at
the
sky
he
shouted
about
his
total
disappointment
about
the
existence
of
other
gods
and
religions
yes
another
god
would
not
have
allowed
it
he
would
never
have
allowed
a
man
like
yeshua
to
be
burnt
by
the
sun
on
a
post
i
was
mistaken
levi
cried
in
a
completely
hoarse
voice
you
are
a
god
of
evil
or
are
your
eyes
completely
clouded
by
smoke
from
the
temple
censers
and
have
your
ears
ceased
to
hear
anything
but
the
trumpeting
noises
of
the
priests
you
are
not
an
almighty
god
you
are
a
black
god
i
curse
you
god
of
robbers
their
soul
and
their
protector
here
something
blew
into
the
face
of
the
former
tax
collector
and
something
rustled
under
his
feet
it
blew
once
more
and
then
opening
his
eyes
levi
saw
that
either
under
the
influence
of
his
curses
or
owing
to
other
reasons
everything
in
the
world
was
changed
the
sun
had
disappeared
before
reaching
the
sea
where
it
sank
every
evening
having
swallowed
it
a
storm
cloud
was
rising
menacingly
and
inexorably
against
the
sky
in
the
west
its
edges
were
already
seething
with
white
foam
its
black
smoky
belly
was
tinged
with
yellow
the
storm
cloud
was
growling
threads
of
fire
fell
from
it
now
and
again
down
the
jaffa
road
down
the
meagre
hinnom
valley
over
the
tents
of
the
pilgrims
driven
by
the
suddenly
risen
wind
pillars
of
dust
went
flying
levi
fell
silent
trying
to
grasp
whether
the
storm
that
was
about
to
cover
yershalaim
would
bring
any
change
in
the
fate
of
the
unfortunate
yeshua
and
straight
away
looking
at
the
threads
of
fire
cutting
up
the
cloud
he
began
to
ask
that
lightning
strike
yeshua
s
post
repentantly
looking
into
the
clear
sky
that
had
not
yet
been
devoured
by
the
cloud
and
where
the
vultures
were
veering
on
one
wing
to
escape
the
storm
levi
thought
he
had
been
insanely
hasty
with
his
curses
now
god
was
not
going
to
listen
to
him
turning
his
gaze
to
the
foot
of
the
hill
levi
fixed
on
the
place
where
the
strungout
cavalry
regiment
stood
and
saw
that
considerable
changes
had
taken
place
there
from
above
levi
was
able
to
distinguish
very
well
the
soldiers
bustling
about
pulling
spears
out
of
the
ground
throwing
cloaks
on
the
horsehandlers
trotting
towards
the
road
leading
black
horses
by
their
bridles
the
regiment
was
moving
off
that
was
clear
spitting
and
shielding
himself
with
his
hand
from
the
dust
blowing
in
his
face
levi
tried
to
grasp
what
it
might
mean
if
the
cavalry
was
about
to
leave
he
shifted
his
gaze
further
up
and
made
out
a
little
figure
in
a
crimson
military
chlamys
climbing
towards
the
place
of
execution
and
here
a
chill
came
over
the
heart
of
the
former
tax
collector
in
anticipation
of
the
joyful
end
the
man
climbing
the
mountain
in
the
fifth
hour
of
the
robbers
sufferings
was
the
commander
of
the
cohort
who
had
come
galloping
from
yershalaim
accompanied
by
an
aide
at
a
gesture
from
ratslayer
the
file
of
soldiers
parted
and
the
centurion
saluted
the
tribune
the
latter
taking
ratslayer
aside
whispered
something
to
him
the
centurion
saluted
him
asecond
time
and
moved
towards
the
group
of
executioners
who
were
sitting
on
stones
at
the
foot
of
the
posts
the
tribune
meanwhile
directed
his
steps
towards
the
one
sitting
on
the
threelegged
stool
and
the
seated
man
politely
rose
to
meet
the
tribune
and
the
tribune
said
something
to
him
in
a
low
voice
and
the
two
went
over
to
the
posts
they
were
joined
by
the
head
of
the
temple
guard
ratslayer
casting
a
squeamish
sidelong
glance
at
the
dirty
rags
lying
on
the
ground
near
the
posts
rags
that
had
recently
been
the
criminals
clothing
and
which
the
executioners
had
rejected
called
two
of
them
and
ordered
follow
me
from
the
nearest
post
came
a
hoarse
senseless
song
gestas
hanging
on
it
had
lost
his
mind
from
the
flies
and
sun
towards
the
end
of
the
third
hour
and
was
now
quietly
singing
something
about
grapes
but
his
head
covered
with
a
turban
occasionally
swayed
all
the
same
and
then
the
flies
rose
sluggishly
from
his
face
and
settled
on
it
again
dysmas
on
the
second
post
suffered
more
than
the
other
two
because
he
did
not
lose
consciousness
and
he
swung
his
head
constantly
and
rhythmically
right
and
left
so
that
his
ears
struck
his
shoulders
yeshua
was
more
fortunate
than
the
other
two
in
the
very
first
hour
he
began
to
have
blackouts
and
then
he
fell
into
oblivion
hanging
his
head
in
its
unwound
turban
the
flies
and
horseflies
therefore
covered
him
completely
so
that
his
face
disappeared
under
the
black
swarming
mass
in
his
groin
and
on
his
belly
and
in
his
armpits
fat
horseflies
sat
sucking
at
his
yellow
naked
body
obeying
the
gestures
of
the
man
in
the
hood
one
of
the
executioners
took
a
spear
and
another
brought
a
bucket
and
a
sponge
to
the
post
the
first
executioner
raised
the
spear
and
with
it
tapped
first
one
then
the
other
of
yeshua
s
arms
stretched
out
and
bound
with
ropes
to
the
crossbar
of
the
post
the
body
with
its
protruding
ribs
gave
a
start
the
executioner
passed
the
tip
of
the
spear
overthe
belly
then
yeshua
raised
his
head
and
the
flies
moved
off
with
a
buzz
revealing
the
face
of
the
hanged
man
swollen
with
bites
the
eyes
puffy
an
unrecognizable
face
ungluing
his
eyelids
hanozri
looked
down
his
eyes
usually
clear
were
slightly
clouded
hanozri
said
the
executioner
hanozri
moved
his
swollen
lips
and
answered
in
a
hoarse
robber
s
voice
what
do
you
want
why
have
you
come
to
me
drink
said
the
executioner
and
a
watersoaked
sponge
on
the
tip
of
a
spear
rose
to
yeshua
s
lips
joy
flashed
in
his
eyes
he
clung
to
the
sponge
and
began
greedily
imbibing
the
moisture
from
the
neighbouring
post
came
the
voice
of
dysmas
injustice
i
m
a
robber
just
like
him
dysmas
strained
but
was
unable
to
move
his
arms
being
bound
to
the
crossbar
in
three
places
with
loops
of
rope
he
drew
in
his
belly
clawed
the
ends
of
the
crossbar
with
his
nails
kept
his
head
turned
towards
yeshua
s
post
malice
blazed
in
the
eyes
of
dysmas
a
dusty
cloud
covered
the
place
it
became
much
darker
when
the
dust
blew
away
the
centurion
shouted
silence
on
the
second
post
dysmas
fell
silent
yeshua
tore
himself
away
from
the
sponge
and
trying
to
make
his
voice
sound
gentle
and
persuasive
but
not
succeeding
he
begged
the
executioner
hoarsely
give
him
a
drink
it
was
growing
ever
darker
the
storm
cloud
had
already
poured
across
half
the
sky
aiming
towards
yershalaim
boiling
white
clouds
raced
ahead
of
the
storm
cloud
suffused
with
black
moisture
and
fire
there
was
a
flash
and
a
thunderclap
right
over
the
hill
the
executioner
removed
the
sponge
from
the
spear
praise
the
magnanimous
hegemon
he
whispered
solemnly
and
gently
pricked
yeshua
in
the
heart
he
twitched
and
whispered
hegemon
blood
ran
down
his
belly
his
lower
jaw
twitched
convulsively
and
his
head
dropped
at
the
second
thunderclap
the
executioner
was
already
giving
dysmas
a
drink
and
with
the
same
words
praise
the
hegemon
killed
him
as
well
gestas
deprived
of
reason
cried
out
fearfully
as
soon
as
the
executioner
came
near
him
but
when
the
sponge
touched
his
lips
he
growled
something
and
seized
it
with
his
teeth
a
few
seconds
later
his
body
too
slumped
as
much
as
the
ropes
would
allow
the
man
in
the
hood
followed
the
executioner
and
the
centurion
and
after
him
came
the
head
of
the
temple
guard
stopping
at
the
first
post
the
man
in
the
hood
examined
the
bloodcovered
yeshua
attentively
touched
his
foot
with
his
white
hand
and
said
to
his
companions
dead
the
same
was
repeated
at
the
other
two
posts
after
that
the
tribune
motioned
to
the
centurion
and
turning
started
off
the
hilltop
together
with
the
head
of
the
temple
guard
and
the
man
in
the
hood
semidarkness
set
in
and
lightning
furrowed
the
black
sky
fire
suddenly
sprayed
out
of
it
and
the
centurion
s
shout
raise
the
cordon
was
drowned
in
rumbling
the
happy
soldiers
rushed
headlong
down
the
hill
putting
on
their
helmets
darkness
covered
yershalaim
torrents
of
rain
poured
down
suddenly
and
caught
the
centuries
halfway
down
the
hill
the
deluge
fell
so
terribly
that
the
soldiers
were
already
pursued
by
raging
streams
as
they
ran
downhill
soldiers
slipped
and
fell
in
the
sodden
clay
hurrying
to
get
to
the
level
road
along
which
now
barely
visible
through
the
sheet
of
water
the
thoroughly
drenched
cavalry
was
heading
for
yershalaim
a
few
minutes
later
only
one
man
remained
in
the
smoky
brew
of
storm
water
and
fire
on
the
hill
shaking
the
not
uselessly
stolen
knife
falling
from
slippery
ledges
clutching
at
whatever
was
there
sometimes
crawling
on
his
knees
he
strained
towards
the
posts
he
now
vanished
in
total
darkness
now
was
suddenly
illumined
by
a
tremulous
light
having
made
his
way
to
the
posts
already
up
to
his
ankles
in
water
he
tore
off
his
heavy
watersoaked
tallith
remaining
just
in
his
shirt
and
clung
to
yeshua
s
feet
he
cut
the
ropes
on
his
shins
stepped
up
on
the
lower
crossbar
embraced
yeshua
and
freed
his
arms
from
the
upper
bonds
the
naked
wet
body
of
yeshua
collapsed
on
levi
and
brought
him
to
the
ground
levi
wanted
to
heave
it
on
to
his
shoulders
straight
away
but
some
thought
stopped
him
he
left
the
body
with
its
thrownback
head
and
outspread
arms
on
the
ground
in
the
water
and
ran
his
feet
slithering
apart
in
the
clayey
mire
to
the
other
posts
he
cut
the
ropes
on
them
as
well
and
the
two
bodies
collapsed
on
the
ground
several
minutes
passed
and
all
that
remained
on
the
top
of
the
hill
was
these
two
bodies
and
the
three
empty
posts
water
beat
on
the
bodies
and
rolled
them
over
by
that
time
both
levi
and
the
body
of
yeshua
were
gone
from
the
hilltop
chapter
an
unquiet
day
on
friday
morning
that
is
the
day
after
the
accursed
seance
all
the
available
staff
of
the
variety
the
bookkeeper
vassily
stepanovich
lastochkin
two
accountants
three
typists
both
boxoffice
girls
the
messengers
ushers
cleaning
women
in
short
all
those
available
were
not
at
their
places
doing
their
jobs
but
were
all
sitting
on
the
windowsills
looking
out
on
sadovaya
and
watching
what
was
going
on
by
the
wall
of
the
variety
by
this
wall
a
queue
of
many
thousands
clung
in
two
rows
its
tail
reaching
to
kudrinskaya
square
at
the
head
of
the
line
stood
some
two
dozen
scalpers
well
known
to
theatrical
moscow
the
line
behaved
with
much
agitation
attracting
the
notice
of
the
citizens
streaming
past
and
was
occupied
with
the
discussion
of
inflammatory
tales
about
yesterday
s
unprecedented
seance
of
black
magic
these
same
tales
caused
the
greatest
consternation
in
the
bookkeeper
vassily
stepanovich
who
had
not
been
present
at
the
previous
evening
s
performance
the
ushers
told
of
god
knows
what
among
other
things
that
after
the
conclusion
of
the
famous
seancesome
female
citizens
went
running
around
in
the
street
looking
quite
indecent
and
so
on
in
the
same
vein
the
modest
and
quiet
vassily
stepanovich
merely
blinked
his
eyes
listening
to
the
tall
tales
of
these
wonders
and
decidedly
did
not
know
what
to
undertake
and
yet
something
had
to
be
undertaken
and
precisely
by
him
because
he
now
turned
out
to
be
the
senior
member
of
the
whole
variety
team
by
ten
o
clock
the
line
of
people
desiring
tickets
had
swelled
so
much
that
rumour
of
it
reached
the
police
and
with
astonishing
swiftness
detachments
were
sent
both
on
foot
and
mounted
to
bring
this
line
into
some
sort
of
order
however
in
itself
even
an
orderly
snake
a
halfmile
long
presented
a
great
temptation
and
caused
utter
amazement
in
the
citizens
on
sadovaya
that
was
outside
but
inside
the
variety
things
were
also
none
too
great
early
in
the
morning
the
telephones
began
to
ring
and
went
on
ringing
without
interruption
in
likhodeev
s
office
in
rimsky
s
office
at
the
bookkeeper
s
in
the
box
office
and
in
varenukha
s
office
vassily
stepanovich
at
first
made
some
answer
the
boxoffice
girl
also
answered
the
ushers
mumbled
something
into
the
telephones
but
then
they
stopped
altogether
because
to
questions
of
where
likhodeev
varenukha
and
rimsky
were
there
was
decidedly
no
answer
at
first
they
tried
to
get
off
by
saying
likhodeev
s
at
home
but
the
reply
to
this
was
that
they
had
called
him
at
home
and
at
home
they
said
likhodeev
was
at
the
variety
an
agitated
lady
called
started
asking
for
rimsky
was
advised
to
call
his
wife
to
which
the
receiver
sobbing
answered
that
she
was
his
wife
and
that
rimsky
was
nowhere
to
be
found
some
sort
of
nonsense
was
beginning
the
cleaning
woman
had
already
told
everybody
that
when
she
came
to
the
findirector
s
office
to
clean
she
saw
the
door
wide
open
the
lights
on
the
window
to
the
garden
broken
the
armchair
lying
on
the
floor
and
no
one
in
the
office
shortly
after
ten
o
clock
madame
rimsky
burst
into
the
variety
she
was
sobbing
and
wringing
her
hands
vassily
stepanovich
was
utterly
at
a
loss
and
did
not
know
how
to
counsel
her
then
at
half
past
ten
came
the
police
their
first
and
perfectly
reasonable
question
was
what
s
going
on
here
citizens
what
s
this
all
about
the
team
stepped
back
bringing
forward
the
pale
and
agitated
vassily
stepanovich
he
had
to
call
things
by
their
names
and
confess
that
the
administration
of
the
variety
in
the
persons
of
the
director
the
findirector
and
the
administrator
had
vanished
and
no
one
knew
where
that
the
master
of
ceremonies
had
been
taken
to
a
psychiatric
hospital
after
yesterday
s
seance
and
that
to
put
it
briefly
this
seance
yesterday
had
frankly
been
a
scandalous
seance
the
sobbing
madame
rimsky
having
been
calmed
down
as
much
as
possible
was
sent
home
and
the
greatest
interest
was
shown
in
the
cleaning
woman
s
story
about
the
shape
in
which
the
findirector
s
office
had
been
found
the
staff
were
asked
to
go
to
their
places
and
get
busy
and
in
a
short
while
the
investigation
appeared
in
the
variety
building
accompanied
by
a
sharpeared
muscular
ashcoloured
dog
with
extremely
intelligent
eyes
the
whisper
spread
at
once
among
the
variety
staff
that
the
dog
was
none
other
than
the
famous
ace
of
diamonds
and
so
it
was
his
behaviour
amazed
them
all
the
moment
ace
of
diamonds
ran
into
the
findirector
s
office
he
growled
baring
his
monstrous
yellow
fangs
then
crouched
on
his
belly
andwith
some
sort
of
look
of
anguish
and
at
the
same
time
of
rage
in
his
eyes
crawled
towards
the
broken
window
overcoming
his
fear
he
suddenly
jumped
up
on
the
windowsill
and
throwing
back
his
sharp
muzzle
howled
savagely
and
angrily
he
refused
to
leave
the
window
growled
and
twitched
and
kept
trying
to
jump
out
the
dog
was
taken
from
the
office
and
turned
loose
in
the
lobby
whence
he
walked
out
through
the
main
entrance
to
the
street
and
led
those
following
him
to
the
cab
stand
there
he
lost
the
trail
he
had
been
pursuing
after
that
ace
of
diamonds
was
taken
away
the
investigation
settled
in
varenukha
s
office
where
they
began
summoning
in
turn
all
the
variety
staff
members
who
had
witnessed
yesterday
s
events
during
the
seance
it
must
be
said
that
the
investigation
had
at
every
step
to
overcome
unforeseen
difficulties
the
thread
kept
snapping
off
in
their
hands
there
had
been
posters
right
right
but
during
the
night
they
had
been
pasted
over
with
new
ones
and
now
strike
me
dead
there
wasn
t
a
single
one
to
be
found
and
the
magician
himself
where
had
he
come
from
ah
who
knows
but
there
was
a
contract
drawn
up
with
him
i
suppose
so
the
agitated
vassily
stepanovich
replied
and
if
one
was
drawn
up
it
had
to
go
through
bookkeeping
most
assuredly
responded
the
agitated
vassily
stepanovich
then
where
is
it
not
here
the
bookkeeper
replied
turning
ever
more
pale
and
spreading
his
arms
and
indeed
no
trace
of
the
contract
was
found
in
the
files
of
the
bookkeeping
office
nor
at
the
findirector
s
nor
at
likhodeev
s
or
varenukha
s
and
what
was
this
magician
s
name
vassily
stepanovich
did
not
know
he
had
not
been
at
the
seance
yesterday
the
ushers
did
not
know
the
boxoffice
girl
wrinkled
her
brow
wrinkled
it
thought
and
thought
and
finally
said
wo
woland
seems
like
or
maybe
not
woland
maybe
not
woland
maybe
faland
it
turned
out
that
in
the
foreigners
bureau
they
had
heard
precisely
nothing
either
about
any
woland
or
for
that
matter
any
faland
the
magician
the
messenger
karpov
said
that
this
same
magician
was
supposedly
staying
in
likhodeev
s
apartment
the
apartment
was
of
course
visited
at
once
no
magician
was
found
there
likhodeev
himself
was
not
there
either
the
housekeeper
grunya
was
not
there
and
where
she
had
gone
nobody
knew
the
chairman
of
the
management
nikanor
ivanovich
was
not
there
bedsornev
was
not
there
something
utterly
preposterous
was
coming
out
the
whole
top
administration
had
vanished
a
strange
scandalous
seance
had
taken
place
the
day
before
but
who
had
produced
it
and
at
whose
prompting
no
one
knew
and
meanwhile
it
was
drawing
towards
noon
when
the
box
office
was
to
open
but
of
course
there
could
be
no
talk
of
that
a
huge
piece
of
cardboard
was
straight
away
posted
on
the
doors
of
the
variety
reading
today
s
show
cancelled
the
line
became
agitated
beginning
at
its
head
but
after
some
agitation
it
nevertheless
began
to
break
up
and
about
an
hour
later
no
trace
of
it
remained
on
sadovaya
the
investigation
departed
to
continue
its
work
elsewhere
the
staff
was
sent
home
leaving
onlythe
watchmen
and
the
doors
of
the
variety
were
locked
the
bookkeeper
vassily
stepanovich
had
urgently
to
perform
two
tasks
first
to
go
to
the
commission
on
spectacles
and
entertainment
of
the
lighter
type
with
a
report
on
yesterday
s
events
and
second
to
visit
the
finspectacle
sector
so
as
to
turn
over
yesterday
s
receipts
roubles
the
precise
and
efficient
vassily
stepanovich
wrapped
the
money
in
newspaper
crisscrossed
it
with
string
put
it
in
his
briefcase
and
knowing
his
instructions
very
well
set
out
of
course
not
for
a
bus
or
a
tram
but
for
the
cab
stand
the
moment
the
drivers
of
the
three
cabs
saw
a
passenger
hurrying
towards
the
stand
with
a
tightly
stuffed
briefcase
all
three
left
empty
right
under
his
nose
looking
back
at
him
angrily
for
some
reason
struck
by
this
circumstance
the
bookkeeper
stood
like
a
post
for
a
long
time
trying
to
grasp
what
it
might
mean
about
three
minutes
later
an
empty
cab
drove
up
but
the
driver
s
face
twisted
the
moment
he
saw
the
passenger
are
you
free
vassily
stepanovich
asked
with
a
cough
of
surprise
show
your
money
the
driver
replied
angrily
without
looking
at
the
passenger
with
increasing
amazement
the
bookkeeper
pressing
the
precious
briefcase
under
his
arm
pulled
a
tenrouble
bill
from
his
wallet
and
showed
it
to
the
driver
i
won
t
go
the
man
said
curtly
i
beg
your
pardon
the
bookkeeper
tried
to
begin
but
the
driver
interrupted
him
got
any
threes
the
completely
bewildered
bookkeeper
took
two
threerouble
bills
from
his
wallet
and
showed
them
to
the
driver
get
in
he
shouted
and
slapped
down
the
flag
of
the
meter
so
that
he
almost
broke
it
let
s
go
no
change
is
that
it
the
bookkeeper
asked
timidly
a
pocket
full
of
change
the
driver
bawled
and
the
eyes
in
the
mirror
went
bloodshot
it
s
my
third
case
today
and
the
same
thing
happened
with
the
others
too
some
son
of
a
bitch
gives
me
a
tenner
i
give
him
change
fourfifty
he
gets
out
the
scum
about
five
minutes
later
i
look
instead
of
a
tenner
it
s
a
label
from
a
seltzer
bottle
here
the
driver
uttered
several
unprintable
words
another
one
beyond
zubovskaya
a
tenner
i
give
him
three
roubles
change
he
leaves
i
go
to
my
wallet
there
s
a
bee
there
zap
in
the
finger
ah
you
and
again
the
driver
pasted
on
some
unprintable
words
and
no
tenner
yesterday
in
the
variety
here
unprintable
words
some
vermin
of
a
conjurer
did
a
seance
with
tenrouble
bills
unprintable
words
the
bookkeeper
went
numb
shrank
into
himself
and
pretended
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
heard
even
the
word
variety
while
thinking
to
himself
ohoh
having
got
where
he
had
to
go
having
paid
satisfactorily
the
bookkeeper
entered
the
building
and
went
down
the
corridor
towards
the
manager
s
office
and
realized
on
his
way
that
he
had
come
at
the
wrong
time
some
sort
of
tumult
reigned
in
the
offices
of
the
spectacles
commission
a
messenger
girl
ran
past
the
bookkeeper
her
kerchief
all
pushed
back
on
her
head
and
her
eyes
popping
nothing
nothing
nothing
my
dears
she
shouted
addressing
no
one
knew
whom
the
jacket
and
trousers
are
there
but
inside
the
jacket
there
s
nothing
she
disappeared
through
some
door
and
straight
away
from
behind
it
came
the
noise
of
smashing
dishes
the
manager
of
the
commission
s
first
sector
whom
the
bookkeeper
knew
ran
out
of
the
secretary
s
room
but
he
was
in
such
a
state
that
he
did
not
recognize
the
bookkeeper
and
disappeared
without
a
trace
shaken
by
all
this
the
bookkeeper
reached
the
secretary
s
room
which
was
the
anteroom
to
the
office
of
the
chairman
of
the
commission
and
here
he
was
definitively
dumbfounded
from
behind
the
closed
door
of
the
office
came
a
terrible
voice
undoubtedly
belonging
to
prokhor
petrovich
the
chairman
of
the
commission
must
be
scolding
somebody
the
consternated
bookkeeper
thought
and
looking
around
saw
something
else
in
a
leather
armchair
her
head
thrown
back
sobbing
unrestrainedly
a
wet
handkerchief
in
her
hand
legs
stretched
out
into
the
middle
of
the
room
lay
prokhor
petrovich
s
personal
secretary
the
beautiful
anna
richardovna
anna
richardovna
s
chin
was
all
smeared
with
lipstick
and
down
her
peachy
cheeks
black
streams
of
sodden
mascara
flowed
from
her
eyelashes
seeing
someone
come
in
anna
richardovna
jumped
up
rushed
to
the
bookkeeper
clutched
the
lapels
of
his
jacket
began
shaking
him
and
shouting
thank
god
at
least
one
brave
man
has
been
found
everybody
ran
away
everybody
betrayed
us
let
s
go
let
s
go
to
him
i
don
t
know
what
to
do
and
still
sobbing
she
dragged
the
bookkeeper
into
the
office
once
in
the
office
the
bookkeeper
first
of
all
dropped
his
briefcase
and
all
the
thoughts
in
his
head
turned
upsidedown
and
it
must
be
said
not
without
reason
at
a
huge
writing
desk
with
a
massive
inkstand
an
empty
suit
sat
and
with
a
dry
pen
not
dipped
in
ink
traced
on
a
piece
of
paper
the
suit
was
wearing
a
necktie
a
fountain
pen
stuck
from
its
pocket
but
above
the
collar
there
was
neither
neck
nor
head
just
as
there
were
no
hands
sticking
out
of
the
sleeves
the
suit
was
immersed
in
work
and
completely
ignored
the
turmoil
that
reigned
around
it
hearing
someone
come
in
the
suit
leaned
back
and
from
above
the
collar
came
the
voice
quite
familiar
to
the
bookkeeper
of
prokhor
petrovich
what
is
this
isn
t
it
written
on
the
door

someone
peeked
in
the
door
of
the
office
gasped
and
flew
out
the
bookkeeper
felt
his
legs
trembling
and
sat
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
but
did
not
forget
to
pick
up
his
briefcase
anna
richardovna
hopped
around
the
bookkeeper
worrying
his
jacket
and
exclaiming

swore

devil

to
the
writing

nasal
from

into
sobs

the
office
the
hottempered
striped
suit
now
said
angrily
and
with
its
sleeve
it
drew
to
itself
a
fresh
stack
of
papers
with
the
obvious
aim
of
appending
its
decision
to
them

can

anna

and
she

stretching
her
mouth
which
had
lost
all
shape
entirely
anna
richardovna
howled
after
choking
with
sobs
she
caught
her
breath
but
then
began
pouring
out
something
completely
incoherent
and
it
writes
writes
writes
you
could
lose
your
mind
talks
on
the
telephone
a
suit
they
all
ran
away
like
rabbits
the
bookkeeper
only
stood
and
shook
but
here
fate
came
to
his
aid
into
the
secretary
s
room
with
calm
businesslike
strides
marched
the
police
to
the
number
of
two
men
seeing
them
the
beauty
sobbed
still
harder
jabbing
towards
the
door
of
the
office
with
her
hand
let
s
not
cry
now
citizeness
the
first
said
calmly
and
the
bookkeeper
feeling
himself
quite
superfluous
there
ran
out
of
the
secretary
s
room
and
a
minute
later
was
already
in
the
fresh
air
there
was
some
sort
of
draught
in
his
head
a
soughing
as
in
a
chimney
and
through
this
soughing
he
heard
scraps
of
the
stories
the
ushers
told
about
yesterday
s
cat
who
had
taken
part
in
the
seance
ohhoho
might
that
not
be
our
same
little
puss
having
got
nowhere
with
the
commission
the
conscientious
vassily
stepanovich
decided
to
visit
its
affiliate
located
in
vagankovsky
lane
and
to
calm
himself
a
little
he
walked
the
distance
to
the
affiliate
on
foot
the
affiliate
for
city
spectacles
was
housed
in
a
peeling
old
mansion
set
back
from
the
street
and
was
famous
for
the
porphyry
columns
in
its
vestibule
but
it
was
not
the
columns
that
struck
visitors
to
the
affiliate
that
day
but
what
was
going
on
at
the
foot
of
them
several
visitors
stood
in
stupefaction
and
stared
at
a
weeping
girl
sitting
behind
a
small
table
on
which
lay
special
literature
about
various
spectacles
which
the
girl
sold
at
that
moment
the
girl
was
not
offering
any
of
this
literature
to
anyone
and
only
waved
her
hand
at
sympathetic
inquiries
while
at
the
same
time
from
above
from
below
from
the
sides
and
from
all
sections
of
the
affiliate
poured
the
ringing
of
at
least
twenty
overwrought
telephones
after
weeping
for
a
while
the
girl
suddenly
gave
a
start
and
cried
out
hysterically
here
it
comes
again
and
unexpectedly
began
singing
in
a
tremulous
soprano
glorious
sea
sacred
baikal
a
messenger
appeared
on
the
stairs
shook
his
fist
at
someone
and
began
singing
along
with
the
girl
in
a
dull
weakvoiced
baritone
glorious
boat
a
barrel
of
cisco
the
messenger
s
voice
was
joined
by
distant
voices
the
choir
began
to
swell
and
finally
the
song
resounded
in
all
comers
of
the
affiliate
in
the
neighbouring
room
no
which
housed
the
account
comptroller
s
section
one
powerful
slightly
husky
octave
stood
out
particularly
hey
barguzin
make
the
waves
rise
and
fall
bawled
the
messenger
on
the
stairs
tears
flowed
down
the
girl
s
face
she
tried
to
clench
her
teeth
but
her
mouth
opened
of
itself
as
she
sang
an
octave
higher
than
the
messenger
this
young
lad
s
ready
to
frisko
what
struck
the
silent
visitors
to
the
affiliate
was
that
the
choristers
scattered
in
various
places
sang
quite
harmoniously
as
if
the
whole
choir
stood
there
with
its
eyes
fixed
on
some
invisible
director
passersby
in
vagankovsky
lane
stopped
by
the
fence
of
the
yard
wondering
at
the
gaiety
that
reigned
in
the
affiliate
as
soon
as
the
first
verse
came
to
an
end
the
singing
suddenly
ceased
again
as
if
to
a
director
s
baton
the
messenger
quietly
swore
and
disappeared
here
the
front
door
opened
and
in
it
appeared
a
citizen
in
a
summer
jacket
from
under
which
protruded
the
skirts
of
a
white
coat
and
with
him
a
policeman
take
measures
doctor
i
implore
you
the
girl
cried
hysterically
the
secretary
of
the
affiliate
ran
out
to
the
stairs
and
obviously
burning
with
shame
and
embarrassment
began
falteringly
you
see
doctor
we
have
a
case
of
some
sort
of
mass
hypnosis
and
so
it
s
necessary
that
he
did
not
finish
the
sentence
began
to
choke
on
his
words
and
suddenly
sang
out
in
a
tenor
shilka
and
nerchinsk
fool
the
girl
had
time
to
shout
but
without
explaining
who
she
was
abusing
produced
instead
a
forced
roulade
and
herself
began
singing
about
shilka
and
nerchinsk
get
hold
of
yourself
stop
singing
the
doctor
addressed
the
secretary
there
was
every
indication
that
the
secretary
would
himself
have
given
anything
to
stop
singing
but
stop
singing
he
could
not
and
together
with
the
choir
he
brought
to
the
hearing
of
passersby
in
the
lane
the
news
that
in
the
wilderness
he
was
not
touched
by
voracious
beast
nor
brought
down
by
bullet
of
shooters
the
moment
the
verse
ended
the
girl
was
the
first
to
receive
a
dose
of
valerian
from
the
doctor
who
then
ran
after
the
secretary
to
give
the
others
theirs
excuse
me
dear
citizeness
vassily
stepanovich
addressed
the
girl
did
a
black
cat
pay
you
a
visit
what
cat
the
girl
cried
in
anger
an
ass
it
s
an
ass
we
ve
got
sitting
in
the
affiliate
and
adding
to
that
let
him
hear
i
ll
tell
everything
she
indeed
told
what
had
happened
it
turned
out
that
the
manager
of
the
city
affiliate
who
has
made
a
perfect
mess
of
lightened
entertainment
the
girl
s
words
suffered
from
a
mania
for
organizing
all
sorts
of
little
clubs
blew
smoke
in
the
authorities
eyes
screamed
the
girl
in
the
course
of
a
year
this
manager
had
succeeded
in
organizing
a
club
of
lermontov
studies
of
chess
and
checkers
of
pingpong
and
of
horseback
riding
for
the
summer
he
was
threatening
to
organize
clubs
of
freshwater
canoeing
and
alpinism
and
so
today
during
lunchbreak
this
manager
comes
in
with
some
son
of
a
bitch
on
his
arm
the
girl
went
on
hailing
from
nobody
knows
where
in
wretched
checkered
trousers
a
cracked
pincenez
and
with
a
completely
impossible
mug
and
straight
away
the
girl
said
he
recommended
him
to
all
those
eating
in
the
affiliate
s
dining
room
as
a
prominent
specialist
in
organizing
choralsinging
clubs
the
faces
of
the
future
alpinists
darkened
but
the
manager
immediately
called
on
everyone
to
cheer
up
while
the
specialist
joked
a
little
laughed
a
little
and
swore
an
oath
that
singing
takes
no
time
at
all
but
that
incidentally
there
was
a
whole
load
of
benefits
to
be
derived
from
it
well
of
course
as
the
girl
said
the
first
to
pop
up
were
fanov
and
kosarchuk
wellknown
affiliate
toadies
who
announced
that
they
would
sign
up
here
the
rest
of
the
staff
realized
that
there
was
no
way
around
the
singing
and
they
too
had
to
sign
up
for
the
club
they
decided
to
sing
during
the
lunch
break
since
the
rest
of
the
time
was
taken
up
by
lermontov
and
checkers
the
manager
to
set
an
example
declared
that
he
was
a
tenor
and
everything
after
that
went
as
in
a
bad
dream
the
checkered
specialistchoirmaster
bawled
out
do
mi
sol
do
dragged
the
most
bashful
from
behind
the
bookcases
where
they
had
tried
to
save
themselves
from
singing
told
kosarchuk
he
had
perfect
pitch
began
whining
squealing
begging
them
to
be
kind
to
an
old
singingmaster
tapped
the
tuning
fork
on
his
knuckle
beseeched
them
to
strike
up
glorious
sea
strike
up
they
did
and
gloriously
the
checkered
one
really
knew
his
business
they
finished
the
first
verse
here
the
director
excused
himself
said
back
in
a
minute
and
disappeared
they
thought
he
would
actually
come
back
in
a
minute
but
ten
minutes
went
by
and
he
was
not
there
the
staff
was
overjoyed
he
had
run
away
then
suddenly
somehow
of
themselves
they
began
the
second
verse
they
were
all
led
by
kosarchuk
who
may
not
have
had
perfect
pitch
but
did
have
a
rather
pleasant
high
tenor
they
sang
it
through
no
director
they
moved
to
their
places
but
had
not
managed
to
sit
down
when
against
their
will
they
began
to
sing
to
stop
was
impossible
after
three
minutes
of
silence
they
would
strike
up
again
silence
strike
up
then
they
realized
that
they
were
in
trouble
the
manager
locked
himself
in
his
office
from
shame
here
the
girl
s
story
was
interrupted
the
valerian
had
not
done
much
good
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
three
trucks
drove
up
to
the
fence
in
vagankovsky
and
the
entire
staff
of
the
affiliate
the
manager
at
its
head
was
loaded
on
to
them
as
soon
as
the
first
truck
after
lurching
in
the
gateway
drove
out
into
the
lane
the
staff
members
who
were
standing
on
the
platform
holding
each
other
s
shoulders
opened
their
mouths
and
the
whole
lane
resounded
with
the
popular
song
the
second
truck
picked
it
up
then
the
third
and
so
they
drove
on
passersby
hurrying
about
their
own
business
would
cast
only
a
fleeting
glance
at
the
trucks
not
surprised
in
the
least
thinking
it
was
a
group
excursion
to
the
country
and
they
were
indeed
going
to
the
country
though
not
on
an
excursion
but
to
professor
stravinsky
s
clinic
half
an
hour
later
the
bookkeeper
who
had
lost
his
head
completely
reached
the
financial
sector
hoping
finally
to
get
rid
of
the
boxoffice
money
having
learned
from
experience
by
now
he
first
peeked
cautiously
into
the
oblong
hall
where
behind
frostedglass
windows
with
gold
lettering
the
staff
was
sitting
here
the
bookkeeper
discovered
no
signs
of
alarm
or
scandal
it
was
quiet
as
it
ought
to
be
in
a
decent
institution
vassily
stepanovich
stuck
his
head
through
the
window
with
cash
deposits
written
over
it
greeted
some
unfamiliar
clerk
and
politely
asked
for
a
deposit
slip
what
do
you
need
it
for
the
clerk
in
the
window
asked
the
bookkeeper
was
amazed
i
want
to
turn
over
some
cash
i
m
from
the
variety
one
moment
the
clerk
replied
and
instantly
closed
the
opening
in
the
window
with
a
grille
strange
thought
the
bookkeeper
his
amazement
was
perfectly
natural
it
was
the
first
time
in
his
life
that
he
had
met
with
such
a
circumstance
everybody
knows
how
hard
it
is
to
get
money
obstacles
to
it
can
always
be
found
but
there
had
been
no
case
in
the
bookkeeper
s
thirty
yearsof
experience
when
anyone
either
an
official
or
a
private
person
had
had
a
hard
time
accepting
money
but
at
last
the
little
grille
moved
aside
and
the
bookkeeper
again
leaned
to
the
window
do
you
have
a
lot
the
clerk
asked
twentyone
thousand
seven
hundred
and
eleven
roubles
oho
the
clerk
answered
ironically
for
some
reason
and
handed
the
bookkeeper
a
green
slip
knowing
the
form
well
the
bookkeeper
instantly
filled
it
out
and
began
to
untie
the
string
on
the
bundle
when
he
unpacked
his
load
everything
swam
before
his
eyes
he
murmured
something
painfully
foreign
money
flitted
before
his
eyes
there
were
stacks
of
canadian
dollars
british
pounds
dutch
guldens
latvian
lats
estonian
kroons
there
he
is
one
of
those
tricksters
from
the
variety
a
menacing
voice
resounded
over
the
dumbstruck
bookkeeper
and
straight
away
vassily
stepanovich
was
arrested
chapter
hapless
visitors
at
the
same
time
that
the
zealous
bookkeeper
was
racing
in
a
cab
to
his
encounter
with
the
selfwriting
suit
from
firstclass
sleeping
car
no
of
the
kiev
train
on
its
arrival
in
moscow
there
alighted
among
others
a
decentlooking
passenger
carrying
a
small
fibreboard
suitcase
this
passenger
was
none
other
than
the
late
berlioz
s
uncle
maximilian
andreevich
poplavsky
an
industrial
economist
who
lived
in
kiev
on
the
former
institutsky
street
the
reason
for
maximilian
andreevich
s
coming
to
moscow
was
a
telegram
received
late
in
the
evening
two
days
before
with
the
following
content
have
just
been
run
over
by
tramcar
at
patriarch
s
ponds
funeral
friday
three
pm
come
berlioz
maximilian
andreevich
was
considered
one
of
the
most
intelligent
men
in
kiev
and
deservedly
so
but
even
the
most
intelligent
man
might
have
been
nonplussed
by
such
a
telegram
if
someone
sends
a
telegram
saying
he
has
been
run
over
it
is
clear
that
he
has
not
died
of
it
but
then
what
was
this
about
a
funeral
or
was
he
in
a
bad
way
and
foreseeing
death
that
was
possible
but
such
precision
was
in
the
highest
degree
strange
how
could
he
know
he
would
be
buried
on
friday
at
three
pm
an
astonishing
telegram
however
intelligence
is
granted
to
intelligent
people
so
as
to
sort
out
entangled
affairs
very
simple
a
mistake
had
been
made
and
the
message
had
been
distorted
the
word
have
had
undoubtedly
come
there
from
some
other
telegram
in
place
of
the
word
berlioz
which
got
moved
and
wound
up
at
the
end
of
the
telegram
with
such
an
emendation
the
meaning
of
the
telegram
became
clear
though
of
course
tragic
when
the
outburst
of
grief
that
struck
maximilian
andreevich
s
wife
subsided
he
at
once
started
preparing
to
go
to
moscow
one
secret
about
maximilian
andreevich
ought
to
be
revealed
there
is
no
arguing
that
he
felt
sorry
for
his
wife
s
nephew
who
had
died
in
the
bloom
of
life
but
of
course
being
a
practical
man
he
realized
that
there
was
no
special
need
for
his
presence
at
the
funeral
and
nevertheless
maximilian
andreevich
was
in
great
haste
to
go
to
moscow
what
was
the
point
the
point
was
the
apartment
an
apartmentin
moscow
is
a
serious
thing
for
some
unknown
reason
maximilian
andreevich
did
not
like
kiev
and
the
thought
of
moving
to
moscow
had
been
gnawing
at
him
so
much
lately
that
he
had
even
begun
to
sleep
badly
he
did
not
rejoice
in
the
spring
flooding
of
the
dnieper
when
overflowing
the
islands
by
the
lower
bank
the
water
merged
with
the
horizon
he
did
not
rejoice
in
the
staggeringly
beautiful
view
which
opened
out
from
the
foot
of
the
monument
to
prince
vladimir
he
did
not
take
delight
in
patches
of
sunlight
playing
in
springtime
on
the
brick
paths
of
vladimir
s
hill
he
wanted
none
of
it
he
wanted
only
one
thing
to
move
to
moscow
advertising
in
the
newspapers
about
exchanging
an
apartment
on
institutsky
street
in
kiev
for
smaller
quarters
in
moscow
brought
no
results
no
takers
were
found
or
if
they
occasionally
were
their
offers
were
disingenuous
the
telegram
staggered
maximilian
andreevich
this
was
a
moment
it
would
be
sinful
to
let
slip
practical
people
know
that
such
moments
do
not
come
twice
in
short
despite
all
obstacles
he
had
to
succeed
in
inheriting
his
nephew
s
apartment
on
sadovaya
yes
it
was
difficult
very
difficult
but
these
difficulties
had
to
be
overcome
at
whatever
cost
the
experienced
maximilian
andreevich
knew
that
the
first
and
necessary
step
towards
that
had
to
be
the
following
he
must
get
himself
registered
at
least
temporarily
as
the
tenant
of
his
late
nephew
s
three
rooms
on
friday
afternoon
maximilian
andreevich
walked
through
the
door
of
the
room
which
housed
the
management
of
no
bis
on
sadovaya
street
in
moscow
in
the
narrow
room
with
an
old
poster
hanging
on
the
wall
illustrating
in
several
pictures
the
ways
of
resuscitating
people
who
have
drowned
in
the
river
an
unshaven
middleaged
man
with
anxious
eyes
sat
in
perfect
solitude
at
a
wooden
table
may
i
see
the
chairman
the
industrial
economist
inquired
politely
taking
off
his
hat
and
putting
his
suitcase
on
a
vacant
chair
this
seemingly
simple
little
question
for
some
reason
so
upset
the
seated
man
that
he
even
changed
countenance
looking
sideways
in
anxiety
he
muttered
unintelligibly
that
the
chairman
was
not
there
is
he
at
home
asked
poplavsky
i
ve
come
on
the
most
urgent
business
the
seated
man
again
replied
quite
incoherently
but
all
the
same
one
could
guess
that
the
chairman
was
not
at
home
and
when
will
he
be
here
the
seated
man
made
no
reply
to
this
and
looked
with
a
certain
anguish
out
the
window
aha
the
intelligent
poplavsky
said
to
himself
and
inquired
about
the
secretary
the
strange
man
at
the
table
even
turned
purple
with
strain
and
said
again
unintelligibly
that
the
secretary
was
not
there
either
he
did
not
know
when
he
would
be
back
and
that
the
secretary
was
sick
aha
poplavsky
said
to
himself
but
surely
there
s
somebody
in
the
management
me
the
man
responded
in
a
weak
voice
you
see
poplavsky
began
to
speak
imposingly
i
am
the
sole
heir
of
the
late
berlioz
my
nephew
who
as
you
know
died
at
the
patriarch
s
ponds
and
i
am
obliged
in
accordance
with
the
law
to
take
over
the
inheritance
contained
in
our
apartment
no
i
m
not
informed
comrade
the
man
interrupted
in
anguish
but
excuse
me
poplavsky
said
in
a
sonorous
voice
you
are
a
member
of
the
management
and
are
obliged
and
here
some
citizen
entered
the
room
at
the
sight
of
the
entering
man
the
man
seated
at
the
table
turned
pale
management
member
pyatnazhko
the
entering
man
asked
the
seated
man
yes
the
latter
said
barely
audibly
the
entering
one
whispered
something
to
the
seated
one
and
he
thoroughly
upset
rose
from
his
chair
and
a
few
seconds
later
poplavsky
found
himself
alone
in
the
empty
management
room
eh
what
a
complication
as
if
on
purpose
all
of
them
at
once
poplavsky
thought
in
vexation
crossing
the
asphalt
courtyard
and
hurrying
to
apartment
no
as
soon
as
the
industrial
economist
rang
the
door
was
opened
and
maximilian
andreevich
entered
the
semidark
front
hall
it
was
a
somewhat
surprising
circumstance
that
he
could
not
figure
out
who
had
let
him
in
there
was
no
one
in
the
front
hall
except
an
enormous
black
cat
sitting
on
a
chair
maximilian
andreevich
coughed
stamped
his
feet
and
then
the
door
of
the
study
opened
and
koroviev
came
out
to
the
front
hall
maximilian
andreevich
bowed
politely
but
with
dignity
and
said
my
name
is
poplavsky
i
am
the
uncle
but
before
he
could
finish
koroviev
snatched
a
dirty
handkerchief
from
his
pocket
buried
his
nose
in
it
and
began
to
weep
of
the
late
berlioz
of
course
of
course
koroviev
interrupted
taking
his
handkerchief
away
from
his
face
just
one
look
and
i
knew
it
was
you
here
he
was
shaken
with
tears
and
began
to
exclaim
such
a
calamity
eh
what
s
going
on
here
eh
run
over
by
a
tramcar
poplavsky
asked
in
a
whisper
clean
cried
koroviev
and
tears
flowed
in
streams
from
under
his
pincenez
run
clean
over
i
was
a
witness
believe
me
bang
and
the
head
s
gone
crunch
there
goes
the
right
leg
crunch
there
goes
the
left
leg
that
s
what
these
trams
have
brought
us
to
and
obviously
unable
to
control
himself
koroviev
pecked
the
wall
beside
the
mirror
with
his
nose
and
began
to
shake
with
sobs
berlioz
s
uncle
was
genuinely
struck
by
the
stranger
s
behaviour
and
they
say
there
are
no
warmhearted
people
in
our
time
he
thought
feeling
his
own
eyes
beginning
to
itch
however
at
the
same
time
an
unpleasant
little
cloud
came
over
his
soul
and
straight
away
the
snakelike
thought
flashed
in
him
that
this
warmhearted
man
might
perchance
have
registered
himself
in
the
deceased
man
s
apartment
for
such
examples
have
been
known
in
this
life
forgive
me
were
you
a
friend
of
my
late
misha
he
asked
wiping
his
dry
left
eye
with
his
sleeve
and
with
his
right
eye
studying
the
rackedwithgrief
koroviev
but
the
man
was
sobbing
so
much
that
one
could
understand
nothing
except
the
repeated
word
crunch
having
sobbed
his
fill
koroviev
finally
unglued
himself
from
the
wall
and
said
no
i
can
t
take
any
more
i
ll
go
and
swallow
three
hundred
drops
of
tincture
of
valerian
and
turning
his
completely
tearbathed
face
to
poplavsky
he
added
that
s
trams
for
you
pardon
me
but
did
you
send
me
the
telegram
maximilian
andreevich
asked
painfully
puzzling
over
who
this
astonishing
crybaby
might
be
he
did
replied
koroviev
and
he
pointed
his
finger
at
the
cat
poplavsky
goggled
his
eyes
assuming
he
had
not
heard
right
no
it
s
too
much
i
just
can
t
koroviev
went
on
snuffing
his
nose
when
i
remember
the
wheel
over
the
leg
the
wheel
alone
weighs
three
hundred
pounds
crunch
i
ll
go
to
bed
forget
myself
in
sleep
and
here
he
disappeared
from
the
hall
the
cat
then
stirred
jumped
off
the
chair
stood
on
his
hind
legs
front
legs
akimbo
opened
his
maw
and
said
well
so
i
sent
the
telegram
what
of
it
maximilian
andreevich
s
head
at
once
began
to
spin
his
arms
and
legs
went
numb
he
dropped
the
suitcase
and
sat
down
on
a
chair
facing
the
cat
i
believe
i
asked
in
good
russian
the
cat
said
sternly
what
of
it
but
poplavsky
made
no
reply
passport
barked
the
cat
holding
out
a
plump
paw
understanding
nothing
and
seeing
nothing
except
the
two
sparks
burning
in
the
cat
s
eyes
poplavsky
snatched
the
passport
from
his
pocket
like
a
dagger
the
cat
picked
up
a
pair
of
glasses
in
thick
black
frames
from
the
pierglass
table
put
them
on
his
muzzle
thus
acquiring
a
still
more
imposing
air
and
took
the
passport
from
poplavsky
s
twitching
hand
i
wonder
am
i
going
to
faint
or
not
thought
poplavsky
from
far
away
came
koroviev
s
snivelling
the
whole
front
hall
filled
with
the
smell
of
ether
valerian
and
some
other
nauseating
vileness
what
office
issued
this
document
the
cat
asked
peering
at
the
page
no
answer
came
the
th
the
cat
said
to
himself
tracing
with
his
paw
on
the
passport
which
he
was
holding
upside
down
ah
yes
of
course
i
know
that
office
they
issue
passports
to
anybody
whereas
i
for
instance
wouldn
t
issue
one
to
the
likes
of
you
not
on
your
life
i
wouldn
t
i
d
just
take
one
lookat
your
face
and
instantly
refuse
the
cat
got
so
angry
that
he
flung
the
passport
on
the
floor
your
presence
at
the
funeral
is
cancelled
the
cat
continued
in
an
official
voice
kindly
return
to
your
place
of
residence
and
he
barked
through
the
door
azazello
at
his
call
a
small
man
ran
out
to
the
front
hall
limping
sheathed
in
black
tights
with
a
knife
tucked
into
his
leather
belt
redhaired
with
a
yellow
fang
and
with
albugo
in
his
left
eye
poplavsky
felt
he
could
not
get
enough
air
rose
from
his
seat
and
backed
away
clutching
his
heart
see
him
off
azazello
the
cat
ordered
and
left
the
hall
poplavsky
the
other
twanged
softly
i
hope
everything
s
understood
now
poplavsky
nodded
return
immediately
to
kiev
azazello
went
on
sit
there
stiller
than
water
lower
than
grass
and
don
t
dream
of
any
apartments
in
moscow
clear
this
small
man
who
drove
poplavsky
to
mortal
terror
with
his
fang
knife
and
blind
eye
only
came
up
to
the
economist
s
shoulder
but
his
actions
were
energetic
precise
and
efficient
first
of
all
he
picked
up
the
passport
and
handed
it
to
maximilian
andreevich
and
the
latter
took
the
booklet
with
a
dead
hand
then
the
one
named
azazello
picked
up
the
suitcase
with
one
hand
with
the
other
flung
open
the
door
and
taking
berlioz
s
uncle
under
the
arm
led
him
out
to
the
landing
of
the
stairway
poplavsky
leaned
against
the
wall
without
any
key
azazello
opened
the
suitcase
took
out
of
it
a
huge
roast
chicken
with
a
missing
leg
wrapped
in
greasy
newspaper
and
placed
it
on
the
landing
then
he
took
out
two
pairs
of
underwear
a
razorstrop
some
book
and
a
case
and
shoved
it
all
down
the
stairwell
with
his
foot
except
for
the
chicken
the
emptied
suitcase
went
the
same
way
there
came
a
crash
from
below
and
judging
by
the
sound
of
it
the
lid
broke
off
then
the
redhaired
bandit
grabbed
the
chicken
by
the
leg
and
with
this
whole
chicken
hit
poplavsky
on
the
neck
flat
hard
and
so
terribly
that
the
body
of
the
chicken
tore
off
and
the
leg
remained
in
azazello
s
hand
everything
was
confusion
in
the
oblonskys
home
as
the
famous
writer
leo
tolstoy
correctly
put
it
precisely
so
he
might
have
said
on
this
occasion
yes
everything
was
confusion
in
poplavsky
s
eyes
a
long
spark
flew
before
his
eyes
then
gave
place
to
some
funereal
snake
that
momentarily
extinguished
the
may
day
and
poplavsky
went
hurtling
down
the
stairs
clutching
his
passport
in
his
hand
reaching
the
turn
he
smashed
the
window
on
the
landing
with
his
foot
and
sat
on
a
step
the
legless
chicken
went
bouncing
past
him
and
fell
down
the
stairwell
azazello
who
stayed
upstairs
instantly
gnawed
the
chicken
leg
clean
stuck
the
bone
into
the
side
pocket
of
his
tights
went
back
to
the
apartment
and
shut
the
door
behind
him
with
a
bang
at
that
moment
there
began
to
be
heard
from
below
the
cautious
steps
of
someone
coming
up
having
run
down
one
more
flight
of
stairs
poplavsky
sat
on
a
wooden
bench
on
the
landing
and
caught
his
breath
some
tiny
elderly
man
with
an
extraordinarily
melancholy
face
in
an
oldfashioned
tussore
silk
suit
and
a
hard
straw
hat
with
a
green
band
on
his
way
upstairs
stopped
beside
poplavsky
may
i
ask
you
citizen
the
man
in
tussore
silk
asked
sadly
where
apartment
no
is
further
up
poplavsky
replied
curtly
i
humbly
thank
you
citizen
the
little
man
said
with
the
same
sadness
and
went
on
up
while
poplavsky
got
to
his
feet
and
ran
down
the
question
arises
whether
it
might
have
been
the
police
that
maximilian
andreevich
was
hastening
to
to
complain
about
the
bandits
who
had
perpetrated
savage
violence
upon
him
in
broad
daylight
no
by
no
means
that
can
be
said
with
certainty
to
go
into
a
police
station
and
tell
them
look
here
just
now
a
cat
in
eyeglasses
read
my
passport
and
then
a
man
in
tights
with
a
knife
no
citizens
maximilian
andreevich
was
indeed
an
intelligent
man
he
was
already
downstairs
and
saw
just
by
the
exit
a
door
leading
to
some
closet
the
glass
in
the
door
was
broken
poplavsky
hid
his
passport
in
his
pocket
and
looked
around
hoping
to
see
his
throwndown
belongings
but
there
was
no
trace
of
them
poplavsky
was
even
surprised
himself
at
how
little
this
upset
him
he
was
occupied
with
another
interesting
and
tempting
thought
of
testing
the
accursed
apartment
one
more
time
on
this
little
man
in
fact
since
he
had
inquired
after
its
whereabouts
it
meant
he
was
going
there
for
the
first
time
therefore
he
was
presently
heading
straight
into
the
clutches
of
the
company
that
had
ensconced
itself
in
apartment
no
something
told
poplavsky
that
the
little
man
would
be
leaving
this
apartment
very
soon
maximilian
andreevich
was
of
course
no
longer
going
to
any
funeral
of
any
nephew
and
there
was
plenty
of
time
before
the
train
to
kiev
the
economist
looked
around
and
ducked
into
the
closet
at
that
moment
way
upstairs
a
door
banged
that
s
him
going
in
poplavsky
thought
his
heart
skipping
a
beat
the
closet
was
cool
it
smelled
of
mice
and
boots
maximilian
andreevich
settled
on
some
stump
of
wood
and
decided
to
wait
the
position
was
convenient
from
the
closet
one
looked
directly
on
to
the
exit
from
the
sixth
stairway
however
the
man
from
kiev
had
to
wait
longer
than
he
supposed
the
stairway
was
for
some
reason
deserted
all
the
while
one
could
hear
well
and
finally
a
door
banged
on
the
fifth
floor
poplavsky
froze
yes
those
were
his
little
steps
he
s
coming
down
a
door
one
flight
lower
opened
the
little
steps
ceased
a
woman
s
voice
the
voice
of
the
sad
man
yes
it
s
his
voice
saying
something
like
leave
me
alone
for
christ
s
sake
poplavsky
s
ear
stuck
through
the
broken
glass
this
ear
caught
a
woman
s
laughter
quick
and
brisk
steps
coming
down
and
now
a
woman
s
back
flashed
by
this
woman
carrying
a
green
oilcloth
bag
went
out
through
the
front
hall
to
the
courtyard
and
the
little
man
s
steps
came
anew
strange
he
s
going
back
up
to
the
apartment
does
it
mean
he
s
part
ofthe
gang
himself
yes
he
s
going
back
they
ve
opened
the
door
again
upstairs
well
then
let
s
wait
a
little
longer
this
time
he
did
not
have
to
wait
long
the
sound
of
the
door
the
little
steps
the
little
steps
cease
a
desperate
cry
a
cat
s
miaowing
the
little
steps
quick
rapid
down
down
down
poplavsky
had
not
waited
in
vain
crossing
himself
and
muttering
something
the
melancholy
little
man
rushed
past
him
hatless
with
a
completely
crazed
face
his
bald
head
all
scratched
and
his
trousers
completely
wet
he
began
tearing
at
the
handle
of
the
front
door
unable
in
his
fear
to
determine
whether
it
opened
out
or
in
managed
at
last
and
flew
out
into
the
sun
in
the
courtyard
the
testing
of
the
apartment
had
been
performed
thinking
no
more
either
of
the
deceased
nephew
or
of
the
apartment
shuddering
at
the
thought
of
the
risk
he
had
been
running
maximilian
andreevich
whispering
only
the
three
words
it
s
all
clear
it
s
all
clear
ran
out
to
the
courtyard
a
few
minutes
later
the
bus
was
carrying
the
industrial
economist
in
the
direction
of
the
kiev
station
as
for
the
tiny
little
man
a
most
unpleasant
story
had
gone
on
with
him
while
the
economist
was
sitting
in
the
closet
downstairs
the
little
man
was
barman
at
the
variety
and
was
called
andrei
fokich
sokov
while
the
investigation
was
going
on
in
the
variety
andrei
fokich
kept
himself
apart
from
all
that
was
happening
and
only
one
thing
could
be
noticed
that
he
became
still
sadder
than
he
generally
was
and
besides
that
he
inquired
of
the
messenger
karpov
where
the
visiting
magician
was
staying
and
so
after
parting
with
the
economist
on
the
landing
the
barman
went
up
to
the
fifth
floor
and
rang
at
apartment
no
the
door
was
opened
for
him
immediately
but
the
barman
gave
a
start
backed
away
and
did
not
enter
at
once
this
was
understandable
the
door
had
been
opened
by
a
girl
who
was
wearing
nothing
but
a
coquettish
little
lacy
apron
and
a
white
fichu
on
her
head
on
her
feet
however
she
had
golden
slippers
the
girl
was
distinguished
by
an
irreproachable
figure
and
the
only
thing
that
might
have
been
considered
a
defect
in
her
appearance
was
the
purple
scar
on
her
neck
well
come
in
then
since
you
rang
said
the
girl
fixing
her
lewd
green
eyes
on
the
barman
andrei
fokich
gasped
blinked
his
eyes
and
stepped
into
the
front
hall
taking
off
his
hat
just
then
the
telephone
in
the
front
hall
rang
the
shameless
maid
put
one
foot
on
a
chair
picked
up
the
receiver
and
into
it
said
hello
the
barman
not
knowing
where
to
look
stood
shifting
from
one
foot
to
the
other
thinking
some
maid
this
foreigner
s
got
pah
nasty
thing
and
to
save
himself
from
the
nasty
thing
he
began
casting
sidelong
glances
around
him
the
whole
big
and
semidark
hall
was
cluttered
with
unusual
objects
and
clothing
thus
thrown
over
the
back
of
a
chair
was
a
funereal
cloak
lined
with
fiery
cloth
on
the
pierglass
table
lay
a
long
sword
with
a
gleaming
gold
hilt
three
swords
with
silver
hilts
stood
in
the
corner
like
mere
umbrellas
or
canes
and
on
the
staghorns
hung
berets
with
eagle
feathers
yes
the
maid
was
saying
into
the
telephone
how
s
that
baron
meigel
i
m
listening
yes
mister
artiste
is
at
home
today
yes
he
ll
be
glad
to
see
you
yes
guests
a
tailcoat
or
a
black
suit
what
by
twelve
midnight
having
finished
the
conversation
the
maid
hung
up
the
receiver
and
turned
to
the
barman
what
would
you
like
i
must
see
the
citizen
artiste
what
you
mean
him
himself
himself
the
barman
replied
sorrowfully
i
ll
ask
the
maid
said
with
visible
hesitation
and
opening
the
door
to
the
late
berlioz
s
study
announced
knight
there
s
a
little
man
here
who
says
he
must
see
messire
let
him
come
in
koroviev
s
cracked
voice
came
from
the
study
go
into
the
living
room
the
girl
said
as
simply
as
if
she
were
dressed
like
anyone
else
opened
the
door
to
the
living
room
and
herself
left
the
hall
going
in
where
he
was
invited
the
barman
even
forgot
his
business
so
greatly
was
he
struck
by
the
decor
of
the
room
through
the
stained
glass
of
the
big
windows
a
fantasy
of
the
jeweller
s
utterly
vanished
wife
poured
an
unusual
churchlike
light
logs
were
blazing
in
the
huge
antique
fireplace
despite
the
hot
spring
day
and
yet
it
was
not
the
least
bit
hot
in
the
room
and
even
quite
the
contrary
on
entering
one
was
enveloped
in
some
sort
of
dankness
as
in
a
cellar
on
a
tiger
skin
in
front
of
the
fireplace
sat
a
huge
black
tomcat
squinting
goodnaturedly
at
the
fire
there
was
a
table
at
the
sight
of
which
the
godfearing
barman
gave
a
start
the
table
was
covered
with
church
brocade
on
the
brocade
tablecloth
stood
a
host
of
bottles
roundbellied
mouldy
and
dusty
among
the
bottles
gleamed
a
dish
and
it
was
obvious
at
once
that
it
was
of
pure
gold
at
the
fireplace
a
small
redhaired
fellow
with
a
knife
in
his
belt
was
roasting
pieces
of
meat
on
a
long
steel
sword
and
the
juice
dripped
into
the
fire
and
the
smoke
went
up
the
flue
there
was
a
smell
not
only
of
roasting
meat
but
also
of
some
very
strong
perfume
and
incense
and
it
flashed
in
the
barman
s
mind
for
he
already
knew
of
berlioz
s
death
and
his
place
of
residence
from
the
newspapers
that
this
might
for
all
he
knew
be
a
church
panikhida
that
was
being
served
for
berlioz
which
thought
however
he
drove
away
at
once
as
a
priori
absurd
the
astounded
barman
unexpectedly
heard
a
heavy
bass
well
sir
what
can
i
do
for
you
and
here
the
barman
discovered
in
the
shadows
the
one
he
wanted
the
black
magician
was
sprawled
on
some
boundless
sofa
low
with
pillows
scattered
over
it
as
it
seemed
to
the
barman
the
artiste
was
wearing
only
black
underwear
and
black
pointed
shoes
i
the
barman
began
bitterly
am
the
manager
of
the
buffet
at
the
variety
theatre
the
artiste
stretched
out
his
hand
stones
flashing
on
its
fingers
as
if
stopping
the
barman
s
mouth
and
spoke
with
great
ardour
no
no
no
not
a
word
more
never
and
by
no
means
nothing
from
your
buffet
will
ever
pass
my
lips
i
my
esteemed
sir
walked
past
your
stand
yesterday
and
even
now
i
am
unable
to
forget
either
the
sturgeon
or
the
feta
cheese
my
precious
man
feta
cheese
is
never
green
in
colour
someone
hastricked
you
it
ought
to
be
white
yes
and
the
tea
it
s
simply
swill
i
saw
with
my
own
eyes
some
slovenly
girl
add
tap
water
from
a
bucket
to
your
huge
samovar
while
the
tea
went
on
being
served
no
my
dear
it
s
impossible
i
beg
your
pardon
said
andrei
fokich
astounded
by
this
sudden
attack
but
i
ve
come
about
something
else
and
sturgeon
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
how
do
you
mean
nothing
to
do
with
it
when
it
s
spoiled
they
supplied
sturgeon
of
the
second
freshness
the
barman
said
my
dear
heart
that
is
nonsense
what
is
nonsense
second
freshness
that
s
what
is
nonsense
there
is
only
one
freshness
the
first
and
it
is
also
the
last
and
if
sturgeon
is
of
the
second
freshness
that
means
it
is
simply
rotten
i
beg
your
pardon
the
barman
again
tried
to
begin
not
knowing
how
to
shake
off
the
cavilling
artiste
i
cannot
pardon
you
the
other
said
firmly
i
have
come
about
something
else
the
barman
said
getting
quite
upset
about
something
else
the
foreign
magician
was
surprised
and
what
else
could
have
brought
you
to
me
unless
memory
deceives
me
among
people
of
a
profession
similar
to
yours
i
have
had
dealings
with
only
one
sutlerwoman
but
that
was
long
ago
when
you
were
not
yet
in
this
world
however
i
m
glad
azazello
a
tabouret
for
mister
buffetmanager
the
one
who
was
roasting
meat
turned
horrifying
the
barman
with
his
fangs
and
deftly
offered
him
one
of
the
dark
oaken
tabourets
there
were
no
other
seats
in
the
room
the
barman
managed
to
say
i
humbly
thank
you
and
lowered
himself
on
to
the
stool
its
back
leg
broke
at
once
with
a
crack
and
the
barman
gasping
struck
his
backside
most
painfully
on
the
floor
as
he
fell
he
kicked
another
stool
in
front
of
him
with
his
foot
and
from
it
spilled
a
full
cup
of
red
wine
on
his
trousers
the
artiste
exclaimed
oh
are
you
hurt
azazello
helped
the
barman
up
and
gave
him
another
seat
in
a
voice
filled
with
grief
the
barman
declined
his
host
s
suggestion
that
he
take
off
his
trousers
and
dry
them
before
the
fire
and
feeling
unbearably
uncomfortable
in
his
wet
underwear
and
clothing
cautiously
sat
down
on
the
other
stool
i
like
sitting
low
down
the
artiste
said
it
s
less
dangerous
falling
from
a
low
height
ah
yes
so
we
left
off
at
the
sturgeon
freshness
dear
heart
freshness
freshness
that
should
be
the
motto
of
every
barman
here
wouldn
t
you
like
to
try
in
the
crimson
light
of
the
fireplace
a
sword
flashed
in
front
of
the
barman
and
azazello
laid
a
sizzling
piece
of
meat
on
the
golden
dish
squeezed
lemon
juice
over
it
and
handed
the
barman
a
golden
twopronged
fork
my
humble
i
no
no
try
it
the
barman
put
a
piece
into
his
mouth
out
of
politeness
and
understood
at
once
that
he
was
chewing
something
very
fresh
indeed
and
above
all
extraordinarily
delicious
but
as
he
was
chewing
the
fragrant
juicy
meat
the
barman
nearly
choked
and
fell
a
second
time
from
the
neighbouring
room
a
big
dark
bird
flew
in
and
gently
brushed
the
barman
s
bald
head
with
its
wing
alighting
on
the
mantelpiece
beside
the
clock
the
bird
turned
out
to
be
an
owl
oh
lord
god
thought
andrei
fokich
nervous
like
all
barmen
a
nice
little
apartment
a
cup
of
wine
white
red
what
country
s
wine
do
you
prefer
at
this
time
of
day
my
humble
i
don
t
drink
a
shame
what
about
a
game
of
dice
then
or
do
you
have
some
other
favourite
game
dominoes
cards
i
don
t
play
games
the
already
weary
barman
responded
altogether
bad
the
host
concluded
as
you
will
but
there
s
something
not
nice
hidden
in
men
who
avoid
wine
games
the
society
of
charming
women
table
talk
such
people
are
either
gravely
ill
or
secretly
hate
everybody
around
them
true
there
may
be
exceptions
among
persons
sitting
down
with
me
at
the
banqueting
table
there
have
been
on
occasion
some
extraordinary
scoundrels
and
so
let
me
hear
your
business
yesterday
you
were
so
good
as
to
do
some
conjuring
tricks
i
the
magician
exclaimed
in
amazement
good
gracious
it
s
somehow
even
unbecoming
to
me
i
m
sorry
said
the
barman
taken
aback
i
mean
the
seance
of
black
magic
ah
yes
yes
yes
my
dear
i
ll
reveal
a
secret
to
you
i
m
not
an
artiste
at
all
i
simply
wanted
to
see
the
muscovitesen
masse
and
that
could
be
done
most
conveniently
in
a
theatre
and
so
my
retinue
he
nodded
in
the
direction
of
the
cat
arranged
for
this
seance
and
i
merely
sat
and
looked
at
the
muscovites
now
don
t
go
changing
countenance
but
tell
me
what
is
it
in
connection
with
this
seance
that
has
brought
you
to
me
if
you
please
you
see
among
other
things
there
were
banknotes
flying
down
from
the
ceiling
the
barman
lowered
his
voice
and
looked
around
abashedly
so
they
snatched
them
all
up
and
then
a
young
man
comes
to
my
bar
and
gives
me
a
tenrouble
bill
i
give
him
eightfifty
in
change
then
another
one
also
a
young
man
no
an
older
one
then
a
third
and
a
fourth
i
keep
giving
them
change
and
today
i
went
to
check
the
cash
box
and
there
instead
of
money
cutup
paper
they
hit
the
buffet
for
a
hundred
and
nine
roubles
aiyaiyai
the
artiste
exclaimed
but
can
they
have
thought
those
were
real
bills
i
can
t
admit
the
idea
that
they
did
it
knowingly
the
barman
took
a
somehow
hunched
and
anguished
look
around
him
but
said
nothing
can
they
be
crooks
the
magician
asked
worriedly
of
his
visitor
can
there
be
crooks
among
the
muscovites
the
barman
smiled
so
bitterly
in
response
that
all
doubts
fell
away
yes
there
were
crooks
among
the
muscovites
that
is
mean
woland
was
indignant
you
re
a
poor
man
you
are
a
poor
man
the
barman
drew
his
head
down
between
his
shoulders
making
it
evident
that
he
was
a
poor
man
how
much
have
you
got
in
savings
the
question
was
asked
in
a
sympathetic
tone
but
even
so
such
a
question
could
not
but
be
acknowledged
as
indelicate
the
barman
faltered
two
hundred
and
fortynine
thousand
roubles
in
five
savings
banks
a
cracked
voice
responded
from
the
neighbouring
room
and
two
hundred
tenrouble
gold
pieces
at
home
under
the
floor
the
barman
became
as
if
welded
to
his
tabouret
well
of
course
that
s
not
a
great
sum
woland
said
condescendingly
to
his
visitor
though
as
a
matter
of
fact
you
have
no
need
of
it
anyway
when
are
you
going
to
die
here
the
barman
became
indignant
nobody
knows
that
and
it
s
nobody
s
concern
he
replied
sure
nobody
knows
the
same
trashy
voice
came
from
the
study
the
binomial
theorem
you
might
think
he
s
going
to
die
in
nine
months
next
february
of
liver
cancer
in
the
clinic
of
the
first
moscow
state
university
in
ward
number
four
the
barman
s
face
turned
yellow
nine
months
woland
calculated
pensively
two
hundred
and
fortynine
thousand
rounding
it
off
that
comes
to
twentyseven
thousand
a
month
not
a
lot
but
enough
for
a
modest
life
plus
those
gold
pieces
he
won
t
get
to
realize
the
gold
pieces
the
same
voice
mixed
in
turning
the
barman
s
heart
to
ice
on
andrei
fokich
s
demise
the
house
will
immediately
be
torn
down
and
the
gold
will
be
sent
to
the
state
bank
and
i
wouldn
t
advise
you
to
go
to
the
clinic
the
artiste
went
on
what
s
the
sense
of
dying
in
a
ward
to
the
groans
and
wheezes
of
the
hopelessly
ill
isn
t
it
better
to
give
a
banquet
on
the
twentyseven
thousand
then
take
poison
and
move
on
to
the
other
world
to
the
sounds
of
strings
surrounded
by
drunken
beauties
and
dashing
friends
the
barman
sat
motionless
and
grew
very
old
dark
rings
surrounded
his
eyes
his
cheeks
sagged
and
his
lower
jaw
hung
down
however
we
ve
started
daydreaming
exclaimed
the
host
to
business
show
me
your
cutup
paper
the
barman
agitated
pulled
a
package
from
his
pocket
unwrapped
it
and
was
dumbfounded
the
piece
of
paper
contained
tenrouble
bills
my
dear
you
really
are
unwell
woland
said
shrugging
his
shoulders
the
barman
grinning
wildly
got
up
from
the
tabouret
aand
he
said
stammering
and
if
they
again
that
is
hm
the
artiste
pondered
well
then
come
to
us
again
you
re
always
welcome
i
m
glad
of
our
acquaintance
straight
away
koroviev
came
bounding
from
the
study
clutched
the
barman
s
hand
and
began
shaking
it
begging
andrei
fokich
to
give
his
regards
to
everybody
everybody
not
thinking
very
well
the
barman
started
for
the
front
hall
hella
see
him
out
koroviev
shouted
again
that
naked
redhead
in
the
front
hall
the
barman
squeezed
through
the
door
squeaked
goodbye
and
went
off
like
a
drunk
man
having
gone
down
a
little
way
he
stopped
sat
on
a
step
took
out
the
packet
and
checked
the
tenrouble
bills
were
in
place
here
a
woman
with
a
green
bag
came
out
of
the
apartment
on
that
landing
seeing
a
man
sitting
on
a
step
and
staring
dully
at
some
money
she
smiled
and
said
pensively
what
a
house
we
ve
got
here
s
this
one
drunk
in
the
morning
and
the
window
on
the
stairway
is
broken
again
peering
more
attentively
at
the
barman
she
added
and
you
citizen
are
simply
rolling
in
money
give
some
to
me
eh
let
me
alone
for
christ
s
sake
the
barman
got
frightened
and
quickly
hid
the
money
the
woman
laughed
to
the
hairy
devil
with
you
skinflint
i
was
joking
and
she
went
downstairs
the
barman
slowly
got
up
raised
his
hand
to
straighten
his
hat
and
realized
that
it
was
not
on
his
head
he
was
terribly
reluctant
to
go
back
but
he
was
sorry
about
the
hat
after
some
hesitation
he
nevertheless
went
back
and
rang
what
else
do
you
want
the
accursed
hella
asked
him
i
forgot
my
hat
the
barman
whispered
pointing
to
his
bald
head
hella
turned
around
the
barman
spat
mentally
and
closed
his
eyes
when
he
opened
them
hella
was
holding
out
his
hat
to
him
and
a
sword
with
a
dark
hilt
not
mine
the
barman
whispered
pushing
the
sword
away
and
quickly
putting
on
his
hat
you
came
without
a
sword
hella
was
surprised
the
barman
growled
something
and
quickly
went
downstairs
his
head
for
some
reason
felt
uncomfortable
and
too
warm
in
the
hat
he
took
it
off
and
jumping
from
fear
cried
out
softly
in
his
hands
was
a
velvet
beret
with
a
dishevelled
cock
s
feather
the
barman
crossed
himself
at
the
same
moment
the
beret
miaowed
turned
into
a
black
kitten
and
springing
back
on
to
andrei
fokich
s
head
sank
all
its
claws
into
his
bald
spot
letting
out
a
cry
of
despair
the
barman
dashed
downstairs
and
the
kitten
fell
off
and
spurted
back
up
the
stairway
bursting
outside
the
barman
trotted
to
the
gates
and
left
the
devilish
no
bis
for
ever
what
happened
to
him
afterwards
is
known
perfectly
well
running
out
the
gateway
the
barman
looked
around
wildly
as
if
searching
for
something
a
minute
later
he
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
in
a
pharmacy
he
had
no
sooner
uttered
the
words
tell
me
please
when
the
woman
behind
the
counter
exclaimed
citizen
your
head
is
cut
all
over
some
five
minutes
later
the
barman
was
bandaged
with
gauze
knew
that
the
best
specialists
in
liver
diseases
were
considered
to
be
professors
bernadsky
and
kuzmin
asked
who
was
closer
lit
up
with
joy
on
learning
that
kuzmin
lived
literally
across
the
courtyard
in
a
small
white
house
and
some
two
minutes
later
was
in
that
house
the
premises
were
antiquated
but
very
very
cosy
the
barman
remembered
that
the
first
one
he
happened
to
meet
was
an
old
nurse
who
wanted
to
take
his
hat
but
as
he
turned
out
to
have
no
hat
the
nurse
went
off
somewhere
munching
with
an
empty
mouth
instead
of
her
there
turned
up
near
the
mirror
and
under
what
seemed
some
sort
of
arch
a
middleaged
woman
who
said
straight
away
that
it
was
possible
to
make
an
appointment
only
for
the
nineteenth
not
before
the
barman
at
once
grasped
what
would
save
him
peering
with
fading
eyes
through
the
arch
where
three
persons
were
waiting
in
what
was
obviously
some
sort
of
anteroom
he
whispered
mortally
ill
the
woman
looked
in
perplexity
at
the
barman
s
bandaged
head
hesitated
and
said
well
then
and
allowed
the
barman
through
the
archway
at
that
same
moment
the
opposite
door
opened
there
was
the
flash
of
a
gold
pincenez
the
woman
in
the
white
coat
said
citizens
this
patient
will
go
out
of
turn
and
before
the
barman
could
look
around
him
he
was
in
professor
kuzmin
s
office
there
was
nothing
terrible
solemn
or
medical
in
this
oblong
room
what
s
wrong
with
you
professor
kuzmin
asked
in
a
pleasant
voice
and
glanced
with
some
alarm
at
the
bandaged
head
i
ve
just
learned
from
reliable
hands
the
barman
replied
casting
wild
glances
at
some
group
photograph
under
glass
that
i
m
going
to
die
of
liver
cancer
in
february
of
this
coming
year
i
beg
you
to
stop
it
professor
kuzmin
as
he
sat
there
threw
himself
against
the
high
gothic
leather
back
of
his
chair
excuse
me
i
don
t
understand
you
you
ve
what
been
to
the
doctor
why
is
your
head
bandaged
some
doctor
you
should
ve
seen
this
doctor
the
barman
replied
and
his
teeth
suddenly
began
to
chatter
and
don
t
pay
any
attention
to
the
head
it
has
no
connection
spit
on
the
head
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
liver
cancer
i
beg
you
to
stop
it
pardon
me
but
who
told
you
believe
him
the
barman
ardently
entreated
he
knows
i
don
t
understand
a
thing
the
professor
said
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
pushing
his
chair
back
from
the
desk
how
can
he
know
when
you
re
going
to
die
the
more
so
as
he
s
not
a
doctor
in
ward
four
of
the
clinic
of
the
first
msu
replied
the
barman
here
the
professor
looked
at
his
patient
at
his
head
at
his
damp
trousers
and
thought
just
what
i
needed
a
madman
he
asked
do
you
drink
vodka
never
touch
it
the
barman
answered
a
moment
later
he
was
undressed
lying
on
the
cold
oilcloth
of
the
couch
and
the
professor
was
kneading
his
stomach
here
it
must
be
said
the
barman
cheered
up
considerably
the
professor
categorically
maintained
that
presently
at
least
for
the
given
moment
the
barman
had
no
symptoms
of
cancer
but
since
it
was
so
since
he
was
afraid
and
had
been
frightened
by
some
charlatan
he
must
perform
all
the
tests
the
professor
was
scribbling
away
on
some
sheets
of
paper
explaining
where
to
go
what
to
bring
besides
that
he
gave
him
a
note
for
professor
bouret
a
neurologist
telling
the
barman
that
his
nerves
were
in
complete
disorder
how
much
do
i
owe
you
professor
the
barman
asked
in
a
tender
and
trembling
voice
pulling
out
a
fat
wallet
as
much
as
you
like
the
professor
said
curtly
and
drily
the
barman
took
out
thirty
roubles
and
placed
them
on
the
table
and
then
with
an
unexpected
softness
as
if
operating
with
a
cat
s
paw
he
placed
on
top
of
the
bills
a
clinking
stack
wrapped
in
newspaper
and
what
is
this
kuzmin
asked
twirling
his
moustache
don
t
scorn
it
citizen
professor
the
barman
whispered
i
beg
you
stop
the
cancer
take
away
your
gold
this
minute
said
the
professor
proud
of
himself
you
d
better
look
after
your
nerves
tomorrow
have
your
urine
analysed
don
t
drink
a
lot
of
tea
and
don
t
put
any
salt
in
your
food
not
even
in
soup
the
barman
asked
not
in
anything
ordered
kuzmin
ahh
the
barman
exclaimed
wistfully
gazing
at
the
professor
with
tenderness
gathering
up
his
gold
pieces
and
backing
towards
the
door
that
evening
the
professor
had
few
patients
and
as
twilight
approached
the
last
one
left
taking
off
his
white
coat
the
professor
glanced
at
the
spot
where
the
barman
had
left
his
money
and
saw
no
banknotes
there
but
only
three
labels
from
bottles
of
abraudurso
wine
devil
knows
what
s
going
on
kuzmin
muttered
trailing
the
flap
of
his
coat
on
the
floor
and
feeling
the
labels
it
turns
out
he
s
not
only
a
schizophrenic
but
also
a
crook
but
i
can
t
understand
what
he
needed
me
for
could
it
be
the
prescription
for
the
urine
analysis
ohoh
he
s
stolen
my
overcoat
and
the
professor
rushed
for
the
front
hall
one
arm
still
in
the
sleeve
of
his
white
coat
xenia
nikitishna
he
cried
shrilly
through
the
door
to
the
front
hall
look
and
see
if
all
the
coats
are
there
the
coats
all
turned
out
to
be
there
but
instead
when
the
professor
went
back
to
his
desk
having
peeled
off
his
white
coat
at
last
he
stopped
as
if
rooted
to
the
parquet
beside
his
desk
his
eyes
riveted
to
it
in
the
place
where
the
labels
had
been
there
sat
an
orphaned
black
kitten
with
a
sorry
little
muzzle
miaowing
over
a
saucer
of
milk
whwhat
s
this
may
i
ask
now
this
is
and
kuzmin
felt
the
nape
of
his
neck
go
cold
at
the
professor
s
quiet
and
pitiful
cry
xenia
nikitishna
came
running
and
at
once
reassured
him
completely
saying
that
it
was
of
course
one
of
the
patients
who
had
abandoned
the
kitten
as
happens
not
infrequently
to
professors
they
probably
have
a
poor
life
xenia
nikitishna
explained
well
and
we
of
course
they
started
thinking
and
guessing
who
might
have
abandoned
it
suspicion
fell
on
a
little
old
lady
with
a
stomach
ulcer
it
s
she
of
course
xenia
nikitishna
said
she
thinks
i
ll
die
anyway
and
it
s
a
pity
for
the
kitten
but
excuse
me
cried
kuzmin
what
about
the
milk
did
she
bring
that
too
and
the
saucer
eh
she
brought
it
in
a
little
bottle
and
poured
it
into
the
saucer
here
xenia
nikitishna
explained
in
any
case
take
both
the
kitten
and
the
saucer
away
said
kuzmin
and
he
accompanied
xenia
nikitishna
to
the
door
himself
when
he
came
back
the
situation
had
altered
as
he
was
hanging
his
coat
on
a
nail
the
professor
heard
guffawing
in
the
courtyard
he
glanced
out
and
naturally
was
struck
dumb
a
lady
was
running
across
the
yard
to
the
opposite
wing
in
nothing
but
a
shift
the
professor
even
knew
her
name
marya
alexandrovna
the
guffawing
came
from
a
young
boy
what
s
this
kuzmin
said
contemptuously
just
then
behind
the
wall
in
the
professor
s
daughter
s
room
a
gramophone
began
to
play
the
foxtrot
hallelujah
and
at
the
same
moment
a
sparrow
s
chirping
came
from
behind
the
professor
s
back
he
turned
around
and
saw
a
large
sparrow
hopping
on
his
desk
hm
keep
calm
the
professor
thought
it
flew
in
as
i
left
the
window
everything
s
in
order
the
professor
told
himself
feeling
that
everything
was
in
complete
disorder
and
that
of
course
owing
chiefly
to
the
sparrow
taking
a
closer
look
at
him
the
professor
became
convincedat
once
that
this
was
no
ordinary
sparrow
the
obnoxious
little
sparrow
dipped
on
its
left
leg
obviously
clowning
dragging
it
working
it
in
syncopation
in
short
it
was
dancing
the
foxtrot
to
the
sounds
of
the
gramophone
like
a
drunkard
in
a
bar
saucy
as
could
be
casting
impudent
glances
at
the
professor
kuzmin
s
hand
fell
on
the
telephone
and
he
decided
to
call
his
old
schoolmate
bouret
to
ask
what
such
little
sparrows
might
mean
at
the
age
of
sixty
especially
when
one
s
head
suddenly
starts
spinning
the
sparrow
meanwhile
sat
on
the
presentation
inkstand
shat
in
it
i
m
not
joking
then
flew
up
hung
in
the
air
and
swinging
a
steely
beak
pecked
at
the
glass
covering
the
photograph
portraying
the
entire
university
graduating
class
of
broke
the
glass
to
smithereens
and
only
then
flew
out
the
window
the
professor
dialled
again
and
instead
of
calling
bouret
called
a
leech
bureau
said
he
was
professor
kuzmin
and
asked
them
to
send
some
leeches
to
his
house
at
once
hanging
up
the
receiver
the
professor
turned
to
his
desk
again
and
straight
away
let
out
a
scream
at
this
desk
sat
a
woman
in
a
nurse
s
headscarf
holding
a
handbag
with
the
word
leeches
written
on
it
the
professor
screamed
as
he
looked
at
her
mouth
it
was
a
man
s
mouth
crooked
stretching
from
ear
to
ear
with
a
single
fang
the
nurse
s
eyes
were
dead
this
bit
of
cash
i
ll
just
pocket
the
nurse
said
in
a
male
basso
no
point
in
letting
it
lie
about
here
she
raked
up
the
labels
with
a
bird
s
claw
and
began
melting
into
air
two
hours
passed
professor
kuzmin
sat
in
his
bedroom
on
the
bed
with
leeches
hanging
from
his
temples
behind
his
ears
and
on
his
neck
at
kuzmin
s
feet
on
a
quilted
silk
blanket
sat
the
greymoustached
professor
bouret
looking
at
kuzmin
with
condolence
and
comforting
him
saying
it
was
all
nonsense
outside
the
window
it
was
already
night
what
other
prodigies
occurred
in
moscow
that
night
we
do
not
know
and
certainly
will
not
try
to
find
out
especially
as
it
has
come
time
for
us
to
go
on
to
the
second
part
of
this
truthful
narrative
follow
me
reader
book
two
chapter
margarita
follow
me
reader
who
told
you
that
there
is
no
true
faithful
eternal
love
in
this
world
may
the
liar
s
vile
tongue
be
cut
out
follow
me
my
reader
and
me
alone
and
i
will
show
you
such
a
love
no
the
master
was
mistaken
when
with
bitterness
he
told
ivanushka
in
the
hospital
at
that
hour
when
the
night
was
falling
past
midnight
that
she
had
forgotten
him
that
could
not
be
she
had
of
course
not
forgotten
him
first
of
all
let
us
reveal
the
secret
which
the
master
did
not
wish
to
reveal
to
ivanushka
his
beloved
s
name
was
margarita
nikolaevna
everything
the
master
told
the
poor
poet
about
her
was
the
exact
truth
he
described
his
beloved
correctly
she
was
beautiful
and
intelligent
to
that
one
more
thing
must
be
added
it
can
be
said
with
certainty
that
many
women
would
have
given
anything
to
exchange
their
lives
for
the
life
of
margarita
nikolaevna
the
childless
thirtyyearold
margarita
was
the
wife
of
a
very
prominent
specialist
who
moreover
had
made
a
very
important
discovery
of
state
significance
her
husband
was
young
handsome
kind
honest
and
adored
his
wife
the
two
of
them
margarita
and
her
husband
occupied
the
entire
top
floor
of
a
magnificent
house
in
a
garden
on
one
of
the
lanes
near
the
arbat
a
charming
place
anyone
can
be
convinced
of
it
who
wishes
to
visit
this
garden
let
them
inquire
of
me
and
i
will
give
them
the
address
show
them
the
way
the
house
stands
untouched
to
this
day
margarita
nikolaevna
was
not
in
need
of
money
margarita
nikolaevna
could
buy
whatever
she
liked
among
her
husband
s
acquaintances
there
were
some
interesting
people
margarita
nikolaevna
had
never
touched
a
primus
stove
margarita
nikolaevna
knew
nothing
of
the
horrors
of
life
in
a
communal
apartment
in
short
she
was
happy
not
for
one
minute
never
since
the
age
of
nineteen
when
she
had
married
and
wound
up
in
this
house
had
she
known
any
happiness
gods
my
gods
what
then
did
this
woman
need
what
did
this
woman
need
in
whose
eyes
there
always
burned
some
enigmatic
little
fire
what
did
she
need
this
witch
with
a
slight
cast
in
one
eye
who
had
adorned
herself
with
mimosa
that
time
in
the
spring
i
do
not
know
i
have
no
idea
obviously
she
was
telling
the
truth
she
needed
him
the
master
and
not
at
all
some
gothic
mansion
not
a
private
garden
not
money
she
loved
him
she
was
telling
the
truth
even
i
the
truthful
narrator
though
an
outsider
feel
my
heart
wrung
at
the
thought
of
what
margarita
endured
when
she
came
to
the
master
s
little
house
the
next
day
fortunately
before
she
had
time
to
talk
with
her
husband
who
had
not
come
back
at
the
appointed
time
and
discovered
that
the
master
was
no
longer
there
she
did
everything
to
find
out
something
about
him
and
of
course
found
out
nothing
then
she
went
back
to
herhouse
and
began
living
in
her
former
place
but
as
soon
as
the
dirty
snow
disappeared
from
the
sidewalks
and
streets
as
soon
as
the
slightly
rotten
disquieting
spring
breeze
wafted
through
the
window
margarita
nikolaevna
began
to
grieve
more
than
in
winter
she
often
wept
in
secret
a
long
and
bitter
weeping
she
did
not
know
who
it
was
she
loved
a
living
man
or
a
dead
one
and
the
longer
the
desperate
days
went
on
the
more
often
especially
at
twilight
did
the
thought
come
to
her
that
she
was
bound
to
a
dead
man
she
had
either
to
forget
him
or
to
die
herself
it
was
impossible
to
drag
on
with
such
a
life
impossible
forget
him
whatever
the
cost
forget
him
but
he
would
not
be
forgotten
that
was
the
trouble
yes
yes
yes
the
very
same
mistake
margarita
said
sitting
by
the
stove
and
gazing
into
the
fire
lit
in
memory
of
the
fire
that
had
burned
while
he
was
writing
pontius
pilate
why
did
i
leave
him
that
night
why
it
was
madness
i
came
back
the
next
day
honestly
as
i
d
promised
butit
was
too
late
yes
like
the
unfortunate
matthew
levi
i
came
back
too
late
all
these
words
were
of
course
absurd
because
what
in
fact
would
it
have
changed
if
she
had
stayed
with
the
master
that
night
would
she
have
saved
him
ridiculous
we
might
exclaim
but
we
shall
not
do
so
before
a
woman
driven
to
despair
on
that
same
day
when
all
sorts
of
absurd
turmoil
took
place
provoked
by
the
appearance
of
the
black
magician
in
moscow
on
the
friday
when
berlioz
s
uncle
was
chased
back
to
kiev
when
the
bookkeeper
was
arrested
and
a
host
of
other
quite
stupid
and
incomprehensible
things
took
place
margarita
woke
up
at
around
noon
in
her
bedroom
with
bay
windows
in
the
tower
of
the
house
on
awakening
margarita
did
not
weep
as
she
often
did
because
she
awoke
with
a
presentiment
that
today
something
was
finally
going
to
happen
having
felt
this
presentiment
she
began
to
warm
it
and
nurture
it
in
her
soul
for
fear
it
might
abandon
her
i
believe
margarita
whispered
solemnly
i
believe
something
will
happen
it
cannot
not
happen
because
for
what
indeed
has
lifelong
torment
been
sent
to
me
i
admit
that
i
lied
and
deceived
and
lived
a
secret
life
hidden
from
people
but
all
the
same
the
punishment
for
it
cannot
be
socruel
something
is
bound
to
happen
because
it
cannot
be
that
anything
will
go
on
for
ever
and
besides
my
dream
was
prophetic
i
ll
swear
it
was
so
margarita
nikolaevna
whispered
looking
at
the
crimson
curtains
as
they
filled
with
sun
dressing
anxiously
combing
her
short
curled
hair
in
front
of
the
triple
mirror
the
dream
that
margarita
had
dreamed
that
night
was
indeed
unusual
the
thing
was
that
during
her
winter
sufferings
she
had
never
seen
the
master
in
her
dreams
he
released
her
for
the
night
and
she
suffered
only
in
the
daylight
hours
but
now
she
had
dreamed
of
him
the
dream
was
of
a
place
unknown
to
margarita
hopeless
dismal
under
the
sullen
sky
of
early
spring
in
the
dream
there
was
this
ragged
fleeting
grey
sky
and
under
it
a
noiseless
flock
of
rooks
some
gnarled
little
bridge
and
under
it
a
muddy
spring
runlet
joyless
destitute
halfnaked
trees
a
lone
aspen
and
further
on
among
the
trees
beyond
some
vegetable
patch
a
little
log
structure
a
separate
kitchen
a
bathhouse
devil
knows
what
it
was
everything
around
somehow
lifeless
and
so
dismal
that
one
just
longed
to
hang
oneself
from
that
aspen
by
the
bridge
not
a
puff
of
breeze
not
a
movement
of
the
clouds
and
not
a
living
soul
what
a
hellish
place
for
a
living
man
and
then
imagine
the
door
of
this
log
structure
is
thrown
open
and
he
appears
rather
far
away
but
clearly
visible
he
is
in
tatters
it
is
impossible
to
make
out
what
he
is
wearing
unshaven
hair
dishevelled
sick
anxious
eyes
he
beckons
with
his
hand
calling
her
gasping
in
the
lifeless
air
margarita
ran
to
him
over
the
tussocks
and
at
that
moment
she
woke
up
this
dream
means
only
one
of
two
things
margarita
nikolaevna
reasoned
with
herself
if
he
s
dead
and
beckoned
to
me
it
means
he
has
come
for
me
and
i
will
die
soon
and
that
s
very
good
because
then
my
suffering
will
soon
end
or
else
he
s
alive
and
then
the
dream
can
only
meanone
thing
that
he
s
reminding
me
of
himself
he
wants
to
say
that
we
will
see
each
other
again
yes
we
will
see
each
other
very
soon
still
in
the
same
agitated
state
margarita
got
dressed
and
began
impressing
it
upon
herself
that
essentially
everything
was
turning
out
very
luckily
and
one
must
know
how
to
catch
such
lucky
moments
and
take
advantage
of
them
her
husband
had
gone
on
a
business
trip
for
a
whole
three
days
during
those
three
days
she
was
at
her
own
disposal
and
no
one
could
prevent
her
from
thinking
what
she
liked
or
dreaming
what
she
liked
all
five
rooms
on
the
top
floor
of
the
house
all
of
this
apartment
which
in
moscow
would
be
the
envy
of
tens
of
thousands
of
people
was
entirely
at
her
disposal
however
being
granted
freedom
for
a
whole
three
days
margarita
chose
from
all
this
luxurious
apartment
what
was
far
from
the
best
place
after
having
tea
she
went
to
a
dark
windowless
room
where
suitcases
and
all
sorts
of
old
stuff
were
kept
in
two
large
wardrobes
squatting
down
she
opened
the
bottom
drawer
of
the
first
of
them
and
took
from
under
a
pile
of
silk
scraps
the
only
precious
thing
she
had
in
life
margarita
held
in
her
hands
an
old
brown
leather
album
which
contained
a
photographic
portrait
of
the
master
a
bank
savings
book
with
a
deposit
of
ten
thousand
roubles
in
his
name
the
petals
of
a
dried
rose
pressed
between
sheets
of
tissue
paper
and
part
of
a
fullsized
notebook
covered
with
typescript
and
with
a
charred
bottom
edge
going
back
to
her
bedroom
with
these
riches
margarita
nikolaevna
set
the
photograph
up
on
the
triple
mirror
and
sat
for
about
an
hour
holding
the
firedamaged
book
on
her
knees
leafing
through
it
and
rereading
that
which
after
the
burning
had
neither
beginning
nor
end
the
darkness
that
came
from
the
mediterranean
sea
covered
the
city
hated
by
the
procurator
the
hanging
bridges
connecting
the
temple
with
the
dread
antonia
tower
disappeared
the
abyss
descended
from
the
sky
and
flooded
the
winged
gods
over
the
hippodrome
the
hasmonaean
palace
with
its
loopholes
the
bazaars
caravanserais
lanes
pools
yershalaim
the
great
city
vanished
as
if
it
had
never
existed
in
the
world
margarita
wanted
to
read
further
but
further
there
was
nothing
except
an
irregular
charred
fringe
wiping
her
tears
margarita
nikolaevna
abandoned
the
notebook
rested
her
elbows
on
the
dressing
table
and
reflected
in
the
mirror
sat
for
a
long
time
without
taking
her
eyes
from
the
photograph
then
the
tears
dried
up
margarita
neatly
folded
her
possessions
and
a
few
minutes
later
they
were
again
buried
under
silk
rags
and
the
lock
clicked
shut
in
the
dark
room
margarita
nikolaevna
was
putting
her
coat
on
in
the
front
hall
in
order
to
go
for
a
walk
the
beautiful
natasha
her
housemaid
asked
what
to
prepare
for
the
main
course
and
receiving
the
reply
that
it
made
no
difference
got
into
conversation
with
her
mistress
for
her
own
amusement
and
began
telling
her
god
knows
what
something
about
how
yesterday
in
the
theatre
a
conjurer
began
performing
such
tricks
that
everybody
gasped
gave
away
two
flacons
of
foreign
perfume
and
a
pair
of
stockings
free
to
everybody
and
then
when
the
seance
ended
the
audience
came
outside
and
bang
everybody
turned
out
to
be
naked
margarita
nikolaevna
dropped
on
to
the
chair
in
front
of
the
hall
mirror
and
burst
out
laughing
natasha
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
margarita
nikolaevna
said
you
a
literate
intelligent
girl
they
tell
devil
knows
what
lies
in
the
queues
and
you
go
repeating
them
natasha
flushed
deeply
and
objected
with
great
ardour
that
no
they
weren
t
lying
and
that
she
herself
had
personally
seen
today
in
a
grocer
s
on
the
arbat
one
citizeness
who
came
into
the
shop
wearing
shoes
but
as
she
was
paying
at
the
cash
register
the
shoes
disappeared
from
her
feet
and
she
was
left
in
just
her
stockings
eyes
popping
out
and
a
hole
in
herheel
and
the
shoes
were
magic
ones
from
that
same
seance
and
she
left
like
that
and
she
left
like
that
natasha
cried
blushing
still
more
from
not
being
believed
and
yesterday
margarita
nikolaevna
the
police
arrested
around
a
hundred
people
in
the
evening
women
from
this
seance
were
running
down
tverskaya
in
nothing
but
their
bloomers
well
of
course
it
s
darya
who
told
you
that
said
margarita
nikolaevna
i
noticed
long
ago
that
she
s
a
terrible
liar
the
funny
conversation
ended
with
a
pleasant
surprise
for
natasha
margarita
nikolaevna
went
to
the
bedroom
and
came
back
holding
a
pair
of
stockings
and
a
flacon
of
eaudecologne
telling
natasha
that
she
too
wanted
to
perform
a
trick
margarita
nikolaevna
gave
her
both
the
stockings
and
the
bottle
and
said
her
only
request
was
that
she
not
run
around
on
tverskaya
in
nothing
but
stockings
and
that
she
not
listen
to
darya
having
kissed
each
other
mistress
and
housemaid
parted
leaning
against
the
comfortable
soft
back
of
the
trolleybus
seat
margarita
nikolaevna
rode
down
the
arbat
now
thinking
her
own
thoughts
now
listening
to
the
whispers
of
two
citizens
sitting
in
front
of
her
they
were
exchanging
whispers
about
some
nonsense
looking
around
warily
from
time
to
time
to
make
sure
no
one
was
listening
the
hefty
beefy
one
with
pert
piggish
eyes
sitting
by
the
window
was
quietly
telling
his
small
neighbour
that
the
coffin
had
to
be
covered
with
a
black
cloth
it
can
t
be
the
small
one
whispered
amazed
this
is
something
unheardof
and
what
has
zheldybin
done
amidst
the
steady
humming
of
the
trolleybus
words
came
from
the
window
criminal
investigation
scandal
well
outright
mysticism
from
these
fragmentary
scraps
margarita
nikolaevna
somehow
put
together
something
coherent
the
citizens
were
whispering
about
some
dead
person
they
did
not
name
him
whose
head
had
been
stolen
from
the
coffin
that
morning
this
was
the
reason
why
zheldybin
was
now
so
worried
and
the
two
who
were
whispering
on
the
trolleybus
also
had
some
connection
with
the
robbed
dead
man
will
we
have
time
to
stop
for
flowers
the
small
one
worried
the
cremation
is
at
two
you
say
margarita
nikolaevna
finally
got
tired
of
listening
to
this
mysterious
palaver
about
a
head
stolen
from
a
coffin
and
she
was
glad
it
was
time
for
her
to
get
off
a
few
minutes
later
margarita
nikolaevna
was
sitting
on
one
of
the
benches
under
the
kremlin
wall
settling
herself
in
such
a
way
that
she
could
see
the
manège
margarita
squinted
in
the
bright
sunlight
remembered
her
last
night
s
dream
remembered
how
exactly
a
year
ago
to
the
day
and
the
hour
she
had
sat
next
to
him
on
this
same
bench
and
in
just
the
same
way
as
then
her
black
handbag
lay
beside
her
on
the
bench
he
was
not
beside
her
this
day
but
margarita
nikolaevna
mentally
conversed
with
him
all
the
same
if
you
ve
been
exiled
why
don
t
you
send
me
word
of
yourself
people
do
send
word
have
you
stopped
loving
me
no
for
some
reason
i
don
t
believe
that
it
means
you
were
exiled
and
died
release
me
then
i
beg
you
give
me
freedom
to
live
finally
to
breathe
the
air
margarita
nikolaevna
answered
for
him
herself
you
are
free
am
i
holding
you
then
she
objected
to
him
no
what
kind
of
answer
is
that
no
go
from
my
memory
then
i
ll
be
free
people
walked
past
margarita
nikolaevna
some
man
gave
the
welldressed
woman
a
sidelong
glance
attracted
by
her
beauty
and
her
solitude
he
coughed
and
sat
down
at
the
end
of
the
same
bench
that
margarita
nikolaevna
was
sitting
on
plucking
up
his
courage
he
began
definitely
nice
weather
today
but
margarita
gave
him
such
a
dark
look
that
he
got
up
and
left
there
for
example
margarita
said
mentally
to
him
who
possessed
her
why
in
fact
did
i
chase
that
man
away
i
m
bored
and
there
s
nothing
bad
about
this
lovelace
unless
it
s
the
stupid
word
definitely
why
am
i
sitting
alone
under
the
wall
like
an
owl
why
am
i
excludedfrom
life
she
became
thoroughly
sad
and
downcast
but
here
suddenly
the
same
morning
wave
of
expectation
and
excitement
pushed
at
her
chest
yes
it
will
happen
the
wave
pushed
her
a
second
time
and
now
she
realized
that
it
was
a
wave
of
sound
through
the
noise
of
the
city
there
came
ever
more
distinctly
the
approaching
beat
of
a
drum
and
the
sounds
of
slightly
offkey
trumpets
the
first
to
appear
was
a
mounted
policeman
riding
slowly
past
the
garden
fence
with
three
more
following
on
foot
then
a
slowly
rolling
truck
with
the
musicians
after
that
a
new
open
hearse
moving
slowly
a
coffin
on
it
all
covered
with
wreaths
and
at
the
comers
of
the
platform
four
standing
persons
three
men
and
one
woman
even
from
a
distance
margarita
discerned
that
the
faces
of
the
people
standing
on
the
hearse
accompanying
the
deceased
on
his
last
journey
were
somehow
strangely
bewildered
this
was
particularly
noticeable
with
regard
to
the
citizeness
who
stood
at
the
left
rear
corner
of
the
hearse
this
citizeness
s
fat
cheeks
were
as
if
pushed
out
still
more
from
inside
by
some
piquant
secret
her
puffy
little
eyes
glinted
with
an
ambiguous
fire
it
seemed
that
just
a
little
longer
and
the
citizeness
unable
to
help
herself
would
wink
at
the
deceased
and
say
have
you
ever
seen
the
like
outright
mysticism
the
same
bewildered
faces
showed
on
those
in
the
cortege
who
numbering
three
hundred
or
near
it
slowly
walked
behind
the
hearse
margarita
followed
the
procession
with
her
eyes
listening
to
the
dismal
turkish
drum
fading
in
the
distance
producing
one
and
the
same
boom
boom
boom
and
thought
what
a
strange
funeral
and
what
anguish
from
that
boom
ah
truly
i
d
pawn
my
soul
to
the
devil
just
to
find
out
whether
he
s
alive
or
not
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
who
they
re
burying
berlioz
mikhail
alexandrovich
a
slightly
nasal
male
voice
came
from
beside
her
chairman
of
massolit
the
surprised
margarita
nikolaevna
turned
and
saw
a
citizen
on
her
bench
who
had
apparently
sat
down
there
noiselessly
while
margarita
was
watching
the
procession
and
it
must
be
assumed
absentmindedly
asked
her
last
question
aloud
the
procession
meanwhile
was
slowing
down
probably
delayed
by
traffic
lights
ahead
yes
the
unknown
citizen
went
on
they
re
in
a
surprising
mood
they
re
accompanying
the
deceased
and
thinking
only
about
what
happened
to
his
head
what
head
asked
margarita
studying
her
unexpected
neighbour
this
neighbour
turned
out
to
be
short
of
stature
a
fiery
redhead
with
a
fang
in
a
starched
shirt
a
goodquality
striped
suit
patent
leather
shoes
and
with
a
bowler
hat
on
his
head
his
tie
was
brightly
coloured
the
surprising
thing
was
that
from
the
pocket
where
men
usually
carry
a
handkerchief
or
a
fountain
pen
this
gentleman
had
a
gnawed
chicken
bone
sticking
out
you
see
the
redhead
explained
this
morning
in
the
hall
of
griboedov
s
the
deceased
s
head
was
filched
from
the
coffin
how
can
that
be
margarita
asked
involuntarily
remembering
at
the
same
time
the
whispering
on
the
trolleybus
devil
knows
how
the
redhead
replied
casually
i
suppose
however
that
it
wouldn
t
be
a
bad
idea
to
ask
behemoth
about
it
it
was
an
awfully
deft
snatch
such
a
scandal
and
above
all
it
s
incomprehensible
who
needs
this
head
and
for
what
occupied
though
margarita
nikolaevna
was
with
her
own
thoughts
she
was
struck
all
the
same
by
the
unknown
citizen
s
strange
twaddle
excuse
me
she
suddenly
exclaimed
what
berlioz
the
one
that
today
s
newspapers
the
same
the
same
so
it
means
that
those
are
writers
following
the
coffin
margarita
asked
and
suddenly
bared
her
teeth
well
naturally
they
are
and
do
you
know
them
by
sight
all
of
them
to
a
man
the
redhead
replied
tell
me
margarita
began
to
say
and
her
voice
became
hollow
is
the
critic
latunsky
among
them
how
could
he
not
be
the
redhead
replied
he
s
there
at
the
end
of
the
fourth
row
the
blond
one
margarita
asked
narrowing
her
eyes
ashcoloured
see
he
s
raising
his
eyes
to
heaven
looking
like
a
parson
that
s
him
margarita
asked
nothing
more
peering
at
latunsky
and
i
can
see
the
redhead
said
smiling
that
you
hate
this
latunsky
there
are
some
others
i
hate
margarita
answered
through
her
teeth
but
it
s
not
interesting
to
talk
about
it
the
procession
moved
on
just
then
with
mostly
empty
automobiles
following
the
people
on
foot
oh
well
of
course
there
s
nothing
interesting
in
it
margarita
nikolaevna
margarita
was
surprised
do
you
know
me
in
place
of
an
answer
the
redhead
took
off
his
bowler
hat
and
held
it
out
a
perfect
bandit
s
mug
thought
margarita
studying
her
street
interlocutor
well
i
don
t
know
you
margarita
said
drily
where
could
you
know
me
from
but
all
the
same
i
ve
been
sent
to
you
on
a
little
business
margarita
turned
pale
and
recoiled
you
ought
to
have
begun
with
that
straight
off
she
said
instead
of
pouring
out
devil
knows
what
about
some
severed
head
you
want
to
arrest
me
nothing
of
the
kind
the
redhead
exclaimed
what
is
it
you
start
a
conversation
and
right
away
it
s
got
to
be
an
arrest
i
simply
have
business
with
you
i
don
t
understand
what
business
the
redhead
looked
around
and
said
mysteriously
i
ve
been
sent
to
invite
you
for
a
visit
this
evening
what
are
you
raving
about
what
visit
to
a
very
distinguished
foreigner
the
redhead
said
significantly
narrowing
one
eye
margarita
became
very
angry
a
new
breed
has
appeared
a
street
pander
she
said
getting
up
to
leave
thanks
a
lot
for
such
errands
the
redhead
exclaimed
grudgingly
and
he
muttered
fool
to
margarita
nikolaevna
s
back
scoundrel
she
replied
turning
and
straight
away
heard
the
redhead
s
voice
behind
her
the
darkness
that
came
from
the
mediterranean
sea
covered
the
city
hated
by
the
procurator
the
hanging
bridges
connecting
the
temple
with
the
dread
antonia
tower
disappeared
yershalaim
the
great
city
vanished
as
if
it
had
never
existed
in
the
world
so
you
too
can
just
vanish
away
along
with
your
burnt
notebook
and
driedup
rose
sit
here
on
the
bench
alone
and
entreat
him
to
set
you
free
to
let
you
breathe
the
air
to
go
from
your
memory
her
face
white
margarita
came
back
to
the
bench
the
redhead
was
looking
at
her
narrowing
his
eyes
i
don
t
understand
any
of
this
margarita
began
quietly
it
s
possible
to
find
out
about
the
pages
get
in
snoop
around
you
bribed
natasha
right
but
how
could
you
find
out
my
thoughts
she
scowled
painfully
and
added
tell
me
who
are
you
from
which
institution
what
a
bore
the
redhead
muttered
and
then
said
aloud
i
beg
your
pardon
didn
t
i
tell
you
that
i
m
not
from
any
institution
sit
down
please
margarita
obeyed
unquestioningly
but
even
so
as
she
was
sitting
down
she
asked
once
more
who
are
you
well
all
right
my
name
is
azazello
but
anyhow
that
tells
you
nothing
and
you
won
t
tell
me
how
you
found
out
about
the
pages
and
about
my
thoughts
no
i
won
t
azazello
replied
drily
but
do
you
know
anything
about
him
margarita
whispered
imploringly
well
suppose
i
do
i
implore
you
tell
me
only
one
thing
is
he
alive
don
t
torment
me
well
he
s
alive
he
s
alive
azazello
responded
reluctantly
oh
god
please
no
excitements
and
exclamations
azazello
said
frowning
forgive
me
forgive
me
the
now
obedient
margarita
murmured
of
course
i
got
angry
with
you
but
you
must
agree
when
a
woman
is
invited
in
the
street
to
pay
a
visit
somewhere
i
have
no
prejudices
i
assure
you
margarita
smiled
joylessly
but
i
never
see
any
foreigners
i
haveno
wish
to
associate
with
them
and
besides
my
husband
my
drama
is
that
i
m
living
with
someone
i
don
t
love
but
i
consider
it
an
unworthy
thing
to
spoil
his
life
i
ve
never
seen
anything
but
kindness
from
him
azazello
heard
out
this
incoherent
speech
with
visible
boredom
and
said
sternly
i
beg
you
to
be
silent
for
a
moment
margarita
obediently
fell
silent
the
foreigner
to
whom
i
m
inviting
you
is
not
dangerous
at
all
and
not
a
single
soul
will
know
of
this
visit
that
i
can
guarantee
you
and
what
does
he
need
me
for
margarita
asked
insinuatingly
you
ll
find
that
out
later
i
understand
i
must
give
myself
to
him
margarita
said
pensively
to
which
azazello
grunted
somehow
haughtily
and
replied
thus
any
woman
in
the
world
i
can
assure
you
would
dream
of
just
that
azazello
s
mug
twisted
with
a
little
laugh
but
i
must
disappoint
you
it
won
t
happen
what
kind
of
foreigner
is
that
margarita
exclaimed
in
bewilderment
so
loudly
that
people
passing
by
turned
to
look
at
her
and
what
interest
do
i
have
in
going
to
him
azazello
leaned
towards
her
and
whispered
meaningfully
well
a
very
great
interest
you
d
better
use
the
opportunity
what
exclaimed
margarita
and
her
eyes
grew
round
if
i
understand
you
rightly
you
re
hinting
that
i
may
find
out
about
him
there
azazello
silently
nodded
i
ll
go
margarita
exclaimed
with
force
and
seized
azazello
by
the
hand
i
ll
go
wherever
you
like
azazello
with
a
sigh
of
relief
leaned
against
the
back
of
the
bench
covering
up
the
name
niura
carved
on
it
in
big
letters
and
saying
ironically
difficult
folk
these
women
he
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
stretched
his
legs
way
out
why
for
instance
was
i
sent
on
this
business
behemoth
should
have
gone
he
s
a
charmer
margarita
said
with
a
crooked
and
bitter
smile
stop
mystifying
me
and
tormenting
me
with
your
riddles
i
m
an
unhappy
person
and
you
re
taking
advantage
of
it
i
m
getting
myself
into
some
strange
story
but
i
swear
it
s
only
because
you
lured
me
with
words
about
him
my
head
s
spinning
from
all
these
puzzlements
no
dramas
no
dramas
azazello
returned
making
faces
you
must
also
put
yourself
in
my
position
to
give
some
administrator
a
pasting
or
chuck
an
uncle
out
of
the
house
or
gun
somebody
down
or
any
other
trifle
of
the
sort
that
s
right
in
my
line
but
talking
with
a
woman
in
loveno
thanks
it
s
half
an
hour
now
that
i
ve
been
wangling
you
into
it
so
you
ll
go
i
will
margarita
nikolaevna
answered
simply
be
so
good
as
to
accept
this
then
said
azazello
and
pulling
a
round
little
golden
box
from
his
pocket
he
offered
it
to
margarita
with
the
words
hide
it
now
the
passersby
are
looking
it
ll
come
in
useful
margarita
nikolaevna
you
ve
aged
a
lot
from
grief
in
the
last
halfyear
margarita
flushed
but
said
nothing
and
azazello
went
on
tonight
at
exactly
half
past
nine
be
so
good
as
to
take
off
all
your
clothes
and
rub
your
face
and
your
whole
body
with
this
ointment
then
do
whatever
you
like
only
don
t
go
far
from
the
telephone
at
ten
i
ll
call
you
and
tell
you
all
you
need
to
know
you
won
t
have
to
worry
about
a
thing
you
ll
be
delivered
where
you
need
to
go
and
won
t
be
put
to
any
trouble
understood
margarita
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
replied
understood
this
thing
is
pure
gold
you
can
tell
by
the
weight
so
then
i
understand
perfectly
well
that
i
m
being
bribed
and
drawn
into
some
shady
story
for
which
i
m
going
to
pay
dearly
what
is
all
this
azazello
almost
hissed
you
re
at
it
again
no
wait
give
me
back
the
cream
margarita
clutched
the
box
more
tightly
in
her
hand
and
said
no
wait
i
know
what
i
m
getting
into
but
i
m
getting
into
it
on
account
of
him
because
i
have
no
more
hope
for
anything
in
this
world
but
i
want
to
tell
you
that
if
you
re
going
to
ruin
me
you
ll
be
ashamed
yes
ashamed
i
m
perishing
on
account
of
love
and
striking
herself
on
the
breast
margarita
glanced
at
the
sun
give
it
back
azazello
cried
angrily
give
it
back
and
devil
take
the
whole
thing
let
them
send
behemoth
oh
no
exclaimed
margarita
shocking
the
passersby
i
agree
to
everything
i
agree
to
perform
this
comedy
of
rubbing
in
the
ointment
agree
to
go
to
the
devil
and
beyond
i
won
t
give
it
back
hah
azazello
suddenly
shouted
and
goggling
his
eyes
at
the
garden
fence
began
pointing
off
somewhere
with
his
finger
margarita
turned
to
where
azazello
was
pointing
but
found
nothing
special
there
then
she
turned
back
to
azazello
wishing
to
get
an
explanation
of
this
absurd
hah
but
there
was
no
one
to
give
an
explanation
margarita
nikolaevna
s
mysterious
interlocutor
had
disappeared
margarita
quickly
thrust
her
hand
into
her
handbag
where
she
had
put
the
box
before
this
shouting
and
made
sure
it
was
there
then
without
reflecting
on
anything
margarita
hurriedly
ran
out
of
the
alexandrovsky
garden
chapter
azazello
s
cream
the
moon
in
the
clear
evening
sky
hung
full
visible
through
the
maple
branches
lindens
and
acacias
drew
an
intricate
pattern
of
spots
on
the
ground
in
the
garden
the
triple
bay
window
open
but
covered
by
a
curtain
was
lit
with
a
furious
electric
light
in
margarita
nikolaevna
s
bedroom
all
the
lamps
were
burning
illuminating
the
total
disorder
in
the
room
on
the
blanket
on
the
bed
lay
shifts
stockings
and
underwear
crumpled
underwear
was
also
simply
lying
about
on
the
floor
next
to
a
box
of
cigarettes
crushed
in
the
excitement
shoes
stood
on
the
night
table
next
to
an
unfinished
cup
of
coffee
and
an
ashtray
in
which
a
butt
was
smoking
a
black
evening
dress
hung
over
the
back
of
a
chair
the
room
smelled
of
perfume
besides
that
the
smell
of
a
redhot
iron
was
coming
from
somewhere
margarita
nikolaevna
sat
in
front
of
the
pierglass
with
just
a
bathrobe
thrown
over
her
naked
body
and
in
black
suede
shoes
a
gold
bracelet
with
a
watch
lay
in
front
of
margarita
nikolaevna
beside
the
box
she
had
received
from
azazello
and
margarita
did
not
take
her
eyes
from
its
face
at
times
it
began
to
seem
to
her
that
the
watch
was
broken
and
the
hands
were
not
moving
but
they
were
moving
though
very
slowly
as
if
sticking
and
at
last
the
big
hand
fell
on
the
twentyninth
minute
past
nine
margarita
s
heart
gave
a
terrible
thump
so
that
she
could
not
even
take
hold
of
the
box
right
away
having
mastered
herself
margarita
opened
it
and
saw
in
the
box
a
rich
yellowish
cream
it
seemed
to
her
that
it
smelled
of
swamp
slime
with
the
tip
of
her
finger
margarita
put
a
small
dab
of
the
cream
on
her
palm
the
smell
of
swamp
grass
and
forest
grew
stronger
and
then
she
began
rubbing
the
cream
into
her
forehead
and
cheeks
with
her
palm
the
cream
spread
easily
and
as
it
seemed
to
margarita
evaporated
at
once
having
rubbed
several
times
margarita
glanced
into
the
mirror
and
dropped
the
box
right
on
her
watch
crystal
which
became
covered
with
cracks
margarita
closed
her
eyes
then
glanced
once
again
and
burst
into
stormy
laughter
her
eyebrows
plucked
to
a
thread
with
tweezers
thickened
and
lay
in
even
black
arches
over
her
greening
eyes
the
thin
vertical
crease
cutting
the
bridge
of
her
nose
which
had
appeared
back
then
in
october
when
the
master
vanished
disappeared
without
a
trace
so
did
the
yellowish
shadows
at
her
temples
and
the
two
barely
noticeable
little
webs
of
wrinkles
at
the
outer
comers
of
her
eyes
the
skin
of
her
cheeks
filled
out
with
an
even
pink
colour
her
forehead
became
white
and
clear
and
the
hairdresser
s
waves
in
her
hair
came
undone
from
the
mirror
a
naturally
curly
blackhaired
woman
of
about
twenty
was
looking
at
the
thirtyyearold
margarita
baring
her
teeth
and
shaking
with
laughter
having
laughed
her
fill
margarita
jumped
out
of
her
bathrobe
with
a
single
leap
dipped
freely
into
the
light
rich
cream
and
with
vigorous
strokes
began
rubbing
it
into
the
skin
of
her
body
it
at
once
turned
pink
and
tingly
that
instant
as
if
a
needle
had
been
snatched
from
her
brain
the
ache
she
had
felt
in
her
temple
all
evening
after
the
meeting
in
the
alexandrovsky
garden
subsided
her
leg
and
arm
muscles
grew
stronger
and
then
margarita
s
body
became
weightless
she
sprang
up
and
hung
in
the
air
just
above
the
rug
then
was
slowly
pulled
down
and
descended
what
a
cream
what
a
cream
cried
margarita
throwing
herself
into
an
armchair
the
rubbings
changed
her
not
only
externally
now
joy
was
boiling
up
in
her
in
all
of
her
in
every
particle
of
her
body
which
felt
to
her
like
bubbles
prickling
her
body
all
over
margarita
felt
herself
free
free
of
everything
besides
she
understood
with
perfect
clarity
that
what
was
happening
was
precisely
what
her
presentiment
had
been
telling
her
in
the
morning
and
that
she
was
leaving
her
house
and
her
former
life
for
ever
but
even
so
a
thought
split
off
from
this
former
life
about
the
need
of
fulfilling
just
one
last
duty
before
the
start
of
something
new
extraordinary
which
was
pulling
her
upwards
into
the
air
and
naked
as
she
was
she
ran
from
her
bedroom
flying
up
in
the
air
time
and
again
to
her
husband
s
study
and
turning
on
the
light
rushed
to
the
desk
on
a
page
torn
from
a
notebook
she
pencilled
a
note
quickly
and
in
big
letters
without
any
corrections
forgive
me
and
forget
me
as
soon
as
possible
i
am
leaving
you
for
ever
do
not
look
for
me
it
is
useless
i
have
become
a
witch
from
the
grief
and
calamities
that
have
struck
me
it
s
time
for
me
to
go
farewellmargarita
with
a
completely
unburdened
soul
margarita
came
flying
into
the
bedroom
and
after
her
ran
natasha
loaded
down
with
things
at
once
all
these
things
a
wooden
hanger
with
a
dress
lace
shawls
dark
blue
satin
shoes
on
shoetrees
and
a
belt
all
of
it
spilled
on
the
floor
and
natasha
clasped
her
freed
hands
what
nice
margarita
nikolaevna
cried
loudly
in
a
hoarse
voice
how
can
it
be
natasha
whispered
backing
away
how
did
you
do
it
margarita
nikolaevna
it
s
the
cream
the
cream
the
cream
answered
margarita
pointing
to
the
glittering
golden
box
and
turning
around
in
front
of
the
mirror
natasha
forgetting
the
wrinkled
dress
lying
on
the
floor
ran
up
to
the
pierglass
and
fixed
her
greedy
litup
eyes
on
the
remainder
of
the
cream
her
lips
were
whispering
something
she
again
turned
to
margarita
and
said
with
a
sort
of
awe
and
oh
the
skin
the
skin
margarita
nikolaevna
your
skin
is
glowing
but
she
came
to
her
senses
ran
to
the
dress
picked
it
up
and
began
shaking
it
out
leave
it
leave
it
margarita
shouted
to
her
devil
take
it
leave
it
all
or
no
keep
it
as
a
souvenir
as
a
souvenir
i
tell
you
take
everything
in
the
room
as
if
halfwitted
the
motionless
natasha
looked
at
margarita
for
some
time
then
hung
on
her
neck
kissing
her
and
crying
out
satin
glowing
satin
and
the
eyebrows
the
eyebrows
take
all
these
rags
take
the
perfume
drag
it
to
your
trunk
hide
it
cried
margarita
but
don
t
take
any
valuables
they
ll
accuse
you
of
stealing
natasha
grabbed
and
bundled
up
whatever
came
to
her
hand
dresses
shoes
stockings
underwear
and
ran
out
of
the
bedroom
just
then
from
somewhere
at
the
other
end
of
the
lane
a
thundering
virtuoso
waltz
burst
and
flew
out
an
open
window
and
the
chugging
of
a
car
driving
up
to
the
gate
was
heard
azazello
will
call
now
exclaimed
margarita
listening
to
the
waltz
spilling
into
the
lane
he
ll
call
and
the
foreigner
s
not
dangerous
yes
i
understand
now
that
he
s
not
dangerous
there
was
the
noise
of
a
car
driving
away
from
the
front
gate
the
garden
gate
banged
and
steps
were
heard
on
the
tiles
of
the
path
it
s
nikolai
ivanovich
i
recognize
his
footsteps
thought
margarita
i
must
do
something
funny
and
interesting
in
farewell
margarita
tore
the
curtain
open
and
sat
sideways
on
the
windowsill
her
arms
around
her
knees
moonlight
licked
her
from
the
right
side
margarita
raised
her
head
towards
the
moon
and
made
a
pensive
and
poetic
face
the
steps
tapped
twice
more
and
then
suddenly
silence
after
admiring
the
moon
a
little
longer
sighing
for
the
sake
of
propriety
margarita
turned
her
head
to
the
garden
and
indeed
saw
nikolai
ivanovich
who
lived
on
the
bottom
floor
of
the
same
house
moonlight
poured
down
brightly
on
nikolai
ivanovich
he
was
sitting
on
a
bench
and
there
was
every
indication
that
he
had
sunk
on
to
it
suddenly
the
pincenez
on
his
face
was
somehow
askew
and
he
was
clutching
his
briefcase
in
his
hands
ah
hello
nikolai
ivanovich
margarita
said
in
a
melancholy
voice
good
evening
coming
back
from
a
meeting
nikolai
ivanovich
made
no
reply
to
that
and
i
margarita
went
on
leaning
further
out
into
the
garden
am
sitting
alone
as
you
see
bored
looking
at
the
moon
and
listening
to
the
waltz
margarita
passed
her
left
hand
over
her
temple
straightening
a
strand
of
hair
then
said
crossly
that
is
impolite
nikolai
ivanovich
i
m
still
a
woman
after
all
it
s
boorish
not
to
reply
when
someone
is
talking
to
you
nikolai
ivanovich
visible
in
the
moonlight
to
the
last
button
on
his
grey
waistcoat
to
the
last
hair
of
his
blond
wedgeshaped
beard
suddenly
smiled
a
wild
smile
rose
from
the
bench
and
apparently
beside
himself
with
embarrassment
instead
of
taking
off
his
hat
waved
his
briefcase
to
the
side
and
bent
his
knees
as
if
about
to
break
into
a
squatting
dance
ah
what
a
boring
type
you
are
nikolai
ivanovich
margarita
went
on
generally
i
m
so
sick
of
you
all
that
i
can
t
even
tell
you
and
i
m
so
happy
to
be
parting
with
you
well
go
to
the
devil
s
dam
just
then
behind
margarita
s
back
in
the
bedroom
the
telephone
exploded
margarita
tore
from
the
windowsill
and
forgetting
nikolai
ivanovich
snatched
the
receiver
azazello
speaking
came
from
the
receiver
dear
dear
azazello
cried
margarita
it
s
time
take
off
azazello
spoke
into
the
receiver
and
it
could
be
heard
in
his
tone
that
he
liked
margarita
s
sincere
and
joyful
impulse
when
you
fly
over
the
gate
shout
invisible
then
fly
over
the
city
a
little
to
get
used
to
it
and
after
that
head
south
out
of
the
city
and
straight
for
the
river
you
re
expected
margarita
hung
up
and
here
something
in
the
next
room
hobbled
woodenly
and
started
beating
on
the
door
margarita
flung
it
open
and
a
sweeping
broom
bristles
up
flew
dancing
into
the
bedroom
it
drummed
on
the
floor
with
its
end
kicking
and
straining
towards
the
window
margarita
squealed
with
delight
and
jumped
astride
the
broom
only
now
did
the
thought
flash
in
the
rider
that
amidst
all
this
fracas
she
had
forgotten
to
get
dressed
she
galloped
over
to
the
bed
and
grabbed
the
first
thing
she
found
some
light
blue
shift
waving
it
like
a
banner
she
flew
out
the
window
and
the
waltz
over
the
garden
struck
up
louder
from
the
window
margarita
slipped
down
and
saw
nikolai
ivanovich
on
the
bench
he
seemed
to
have
frozen
to
it
and
listened
completely
dumbfounded
to
the
shouting
and
crashing
coming
from
the
lighted
bedroom
of
the
upstairs
tenants
farewell
nikolai
ivanovich
cried
margarita
capering
in
front
of
nikolai
ivanovich
he
gasped
and
crawled
along
the
bench
pawing
it
with
his
hands
and
knocking
down
his
briefcase
farewell
for
ever
i
m
flying
away
margarita
shouted
above
the
waltz
here
she
realized
that
she
did
not
need
any
shift
and
with
a
sinister
guffaw
threw
it
over
nikolai
ivanovich
s
head
the
blinded
nikolai
ivanovich
crashed
from
the
bench
on
to
the
bricks
of
the
path
margarita
turned
to
take
a
last
look
at
the
house
where
she
had
suffered
for
so
long
and
saw
in
the
blazing
window
natasha
s
face
distorted
with
amazement
farewell
natasha
margarita
cried
and
reared
up
on
the
broom
invisible
invisible
she
cried
still
louder
and
flying
over
the
front
gates
between
the
maple
branches
which
lashed
at
her
face
she
flew
out
into
the
lane
and
after
her
flew
the
completely
insane
waltz
chapter
flight
invisible
and
free
invisible
and
free
after
flying
down
her
own
lane
margarita
got
into
another
that
crossed
the
first
at
right
angles
this
patched
up
darned
crooked
and
long
lane
with
the
lopsided
door
of
a
kerosene
shop
where
they
sold
paraffin
by
the
cup
and
liquid
against
parasites
in
flacons
she
cut
across
in
an
instant
and
here
she
realized
that
even
while
completely
free
and
invisible
she
still
had
to
be
at
least
somewhat
reasonable
in
her
pleasure
having
slowed
down
only
by
some
miracle
she
just
missed
smashing
herself
to
death
against
an
old
lopsided
street
light
at
the
corner
dodging
it
margarita
clutched
the
broom
tighter
and
flew
more
slowly
studying
the
electric
wires
and
the
street
signs
hanging
across
the
sidewalk
the
third
lane
led
straight
to
the
arbat
here
margarita
became
fully
accustomed
to
controlling
the
broom
realized
that
it
obeyed
the
slightest
touch
of
her
hands
and
legs
and
that
flying
over
the
city
she
had
to
be
very
attentive
and
not
act
up
too
much
besides
in
the
lane
it
had
already
become
abundantly
clear
that
passersby
did
not
see
the
lady
flier
no
one
threw
his
head
back
shouted
look
look
or
dashed
aside
no
one
shrieked
swooned
or
guffawed
with
wild
laughter
margarita
flew
noiselessly
very
slowly
and
not
high
up
approximately
on
secondfloor
level
but
even
with
this
slow
flying
just
at
the
entrance
to
the
dazzlingly
lit
arbat
she
misjudged
slightly
and
struck
her
shoulder
against
some
illuminated
disc
with
an
arrow
on
it
this
angered
margarita
she
reined
in
the
obedient
broom
flew
a
little
aside
and
then
suddenly
hurling
herself
at
the
disc
with
the
butt
of
the
broom
smashed
it
to
smithereens
bits
of
glass
rained
down
with
a
crash
passersby
shied
away
a
whistle
came
from
somewhere
and
margarita
having
accomplished
this
unnecessary
act
burst
out
laughing
on
the
arbat
i
must
be
more
careful
thought
margarita
everything
s
in
such
a
snarl
here
you
can
t
figure
it
out
she
began
dodging
between
the
wires
beneath
margarita
floated
the
roofs
of
buses
trams
and
cars
and
along
the
sidewalks
as
it
seemed
to
margarita
from
above
floated
rivers
of
caps
from
these
rivers
little
streams
branched
off
and
flowed
into
the
flaming
maws
of
nighttime
shops
eh
what
a
mess
margarita
thought
angrily
you
can
t
even
turn
around
here
she
crossed
the
arbat
rose
higher
to
fourthfloor
level
and
past
the
dazzlingly
bright
tubes
on
the
theatre
building
at
the
comer
floated
into
a
narrow
lane
with
tall
buildings
all
the
windows
in
them
were
open
and
everywhere
radio
music
came
from
the
windows
out
of
curiosity
margarita
peeked
into
one
of
them
she
saw
a
kitchen
two
primuses
were
roaring
on
the
range
and
next
to
them
stood
two
women
with
spoons
in
their
hands
squabbling
you
should
turn
the
toilet
light
off
after
you
that
s
what
i
m
telling
you
pelageya
petrovna
said
the
woman
before
whom
there
was
a
pot
with
some
sort
of
eatables
steaming
in
it
or
else
we
ll
apply
to
have
you
evicted
you
re
a
good
one
yourself
the
other
woman
answered
you
re
both
good
ones
margarita
said
loudly
clambering
over
the
windowsill
into
the
kitchen
the
two
quarrelling
women
turned
towards
the
voice
and
froze
with
their
dirty
spoons
in
their
hands
margarita
carefully
reached
out
between
them
turned
the
knobs
of
both
primuses
and
extinguished
them
the
women
gasped
and
opened
their
mouths
but
margarita
was
already
bored
with
the
kitchen
and
flew
out
into
the
lane
her
attention
was
attracted
by
the
magnificent
hulk
of
an
eightstoreyed
obviously
justconstructed
building
at
the
end
of
it
margarita
dropped
down
and
alighting
saw
that
the
façade
of
the
building
was
covered
in
black
marble
that
the
doors
were
wide
that
behind
their
glass
could
be
glimpsed
a
doorman
s
buttons
and
peaked
cap
with
gold
braid
and
that
over
the
door
there
was
a
gold
inscription
dramlit
house
margarita
squinted
at
the
inscription
trying
to
figure
out
what
the
word
dramlit
might
mean
taking
her
broom
under
her
arm
margarita
walked
into
the
lobby
shoving
the
surprised
doorman
with
the
door
and
saw
on
the
wall
beside
the
elevator
a
huge
black
board
and
on
it
written
in
white
letters
apartment
numbers
and
tenants
names
the
heading
house
of
dramatists
and
literary
workers
above
the
list
provoked
a
suppressed
predatory
scream
in
margarita
rising
in
the
air
she
greedily
began
to
read
the
last
names
khustov
dvubratsky
quant
beskudnikov
latunsky
latunsky
shrieked
margarita
latunsky
why
he
s
the
one
he
s
the
one
who
ruined
the
master
the
doorman
at
the
entrance
even
hopping
with
astonishment
his
eyes
rolled
out
gazed
at
the
black
board
trying
to
understand
the
marvel
why
was
the
list
of
tenants
suddenly
shrieking
but
by
that
time
margarita
was
already
going
impetuously
up
the
stairs
repeating
in
some
sort
of
rapture
latunsky
eightyfour
latunsky
eightyfour
here
to
the
left
to
the
right
further
up
to
the
left
here
and
the
name
plate
o
latunsky
margarita
jumped
off
the
broom
and
her
hot
soles
felt
the
pleasant
coolness
of
the
stone
landing
margarita
rang
once
twice
but
no
one
opened
margarita
began
to
push
the
button
harder
and
could
hear
the
jangling
it
set
off
in
latunsky
s
apartment
yes
to
his
dying
day
the
inhabitant
of
apartment
no
on
the
eighth
floor
should
be
grateful
to
the
late
berlioz
chairman
of
massolit
for
having
fallen
under
a
tramcar
and
that
the
memorial
gathering
had
been
appointed
precisely
for
that
evening
the
critic
latunsky
was
born
under
a
lucky
star
it
saved
him
from
meeting
margarita
who
that
friday
became
a
witch
no
one
opened
the
door
then
margarita
raced
down
at
full
swing
counting
the
floors
reached
the
bottom
burst
out
the
door
and
looking
up
counted
and
checked
the
floors
from
outside
guessing
which
precisely
were
the
windows
of
latunsky
s
apartment
undoubtedly
they
were
the
five
dark
windows
at
the
comer
of
the
building
on
the
eighth
floor
convinced
of
it
margarita
rose
into
the
air
and
in
a
few
seconds
was
stepping
through
an
open
window
into
an
unlit
room
where
only
a
narrow
path
from
the
moon
shone
silver
margarita
ran
down
it
felt
for
the
switch
a
moment
later
the
whole
apartment
was
lit
up
the
broom
stood
in
a
comer
after
making
sure
that
no
one
was
home
margarita
opened
the
door
to
the
stairs
and
checked
whether
the
name
plate
was
there
the
name
plate
was
in
place
margarita
was
where
she
wanted
to
be
yes
they
say
that
to
this
day
the
critic
latunsky
turns
pale
remembering
that
terrible
evening
and
to
this
day
he
utters
the
name
of
berlioz
with
veneration
it
is
totally
unknown
what
dark
and
vile
criminal
job
would
have
marked
this
evening
returning
from
the
kitchen
margarita
had
a
heavy
hammer
in
her
hands
naked
and
invisible
the
lady
flier
tried
to
control
and
talk
sense
into
herself
her
hands
trembled
with
impatience
taking
careful
aim
margarita
struck
at
the
keys
of
the
grand
piano
and
a
first
plaintive
wail
passed
all
through
the
apartment
becker
s
drawingroom
instrument
not
guilty
of
anything
cried
out
frenziedly
its
keys
caved
in
ivory
veneer
flew
in
all
directions
the
instrument
howled
wailed
rasped
and
jangled
with
the
noise
of
a
pistol
shot
the
polished
upper
soundboard
split
under
a
hammer
blow
breathing
hard
margarita
tore
and
mangled
the
strings
with
the
hammer
finally
getting
tired
she
left
off
and
flopped
into
an
armchair
to
catch
her
breath
water
was
roaring
terribly
in
the
bathroom
and
in
the
kitchen
as
well
seems
it
s
already
overflowing
on
the
floor
margarita
thought
and
added
aloud
no
point
sitting
around
however
the
stream
was
already
running
from
the
kitchen
into
the
corridor
splashing
barefoot
through
the
water
margarita
carried
buckets
of
water
from
the
kitchen
to
the
critic
s
study
and
emptied
them
into
his
desk
drawers
then
after
smashing
the
door
of
the
bookcase
in
the
same
study
with
her
hammer
she
rushed
to
the
bedroom
shattering
the
mirror
on
the
wardrobe
she
took
out
the
critic
s
dress
suit
and
drowned
it
in
the
tub
a
large
bottle
of
ink
picked
up
inthe
study
she
poured
over
the
luxuriously
plumpedup
double
bed
the
devastation
she
wrought
afforded
her
a
burning
pleasure
and
yet
it
seemed
to
her
all
the
while
that
the
results
came
out
somehow
meagre
therefore
she
started
doing
whatever
came
along
she
smashed
pots
of
ficus
in
the
room
with
the
grand
piano
before
finishing
that
she
went
back
to
the
bedroom
slashed
the
sheets
with
a
kitchen
knife
and
broke
the
glass
on
the
framed
photographs
she
felt
no
fatigue
only
the
sweat
poured
from
her
in
streams
just
then
in
apartment
no
below
latunsky
s
apartment
the
housekeeper
of
the
dramatist
quant
was
having
tea
in
the
kitchen
perplexed
by
the
clatter
running
and
jangling
coming
from
above
raising
her
head
towards
the
ceiling
she
suddenly
saw
it
changing
colour
before
her
eyes
from
white
to
some
deathly
blue
the
spot
was
widening
right
in
front
of
her
and
drops
suddenly
swelled
out
on
it
for
about
two
minutes
the
housekeeper
sat
marvelling
at
this
phenomenon
until
finally
a
real
rain
began
to
fall
from
the
ceiling
drumming
on
the
floor
here
she
jumped
up
put
a
bowl
under
the
stream
which
did
not
help
at
all
because
the
rain
expanded
and
began
pouring
down
on
the
gas
stove
and
the
table
with
dishes
then
crying
out
quant
s
housekeeper
ran
from
the
apartment
to
the
stairs
and
at
once
the
bell
started
ringing
in
latunsky
s
apartment
well
they
re
ringing
time
to
be
off
said
margarita
she
sat
on
the
broom
listening
to
the
female
voice
shouting
through
the
keyhole
open
up
open
up
dusya
open
the
door
is
your
water
overflowing
or
what
we
re
being
flooded
margarita
rose
up
about
a
metre
and
hit
the
chandelier
two
bulbs
popped
and
pendants
flew
in
all
directions
the
shouting
through
the
keyhole
stopped
stomping
was
heard
on
the
stairs
margarita
floated
through
the
window
found
herself
outside
it
swung
lightly
and
hit
the
glass
with
the
hammer
the
pane
sobbed
and
splinters
went
cascading
down
the
marblefaced
wall
margarita
flew
to
the
next
window
far
below
people
began
running
about
on
the
sidewalk
one
of
the
two
cars
parked
by
the
entrance
honked
and
drove
off
having
finished
with
latunsky
s
windows
margarita
floated
to
the
neighbour
s
apartment
the
blows
became
more
frequent
the
lane
was
filled
with
crashing
and
jingling
the
doorman
ran
out
of
the
main
entrance
looked
up
hesitated
a
moment
evidently
not
grasping
at
first
what
he
ought
to
undertake
put
the
whistle
to
hislips
and
started
whistling
furiously
to
the
sound
of
this
whistle
margarita
with
particular
passion
demolished
the
last
window
on
the
eighth
floor
dropped
down
to
the
seventh
and
started
smashing
the
windows
there
weary
of
his
prolonged
idleness
behind
the
glass
doors
of
the
entrance
the
doorman
put
his
whole
soul
into
his
whistling
following
margarita
precisely
as
if
he
were
her
accompanist
in
the
pauses
as
she
flew
from
window
to
window
he
would
draw
his
breath
and
at
each
of
margarita
s
strokes
he
would
puff
out
his
cheeks
and
dissolve
in
whistling
drilling
the
night
air
right
up
to
the
sky
his
efforts
combined
with
the
efforts
of
the
infuriated
margarita
yielded
great
results
there
was
panic
in
the
house
those
windows
left
intact
were
flung
open
people
s
heads
appeared
in
them
and
hid
at
once
while
the
open
windows
on
the
contrary
were
being
closed
in
the
buildings
across
the
street
against
the
lighted
background
of
windows
there
appeared
the
dark
silhouettes
of
people
trying
to
understand
why
the
windows
in
the
new
dramlit
building
werebursting
for
no
reason
at
all
in
the
lane
people
ran
to
dramlit
house
and
inside
on
all
the
stairways
there
was
the
stamping
of
people
rushing
about
with
no
reason
or
sense
quant
s
housekeeper
shouted
to
those
running
up
the
stairs
that
they
were
being
flooded
and
she
was
soon
joined
by
khustov
s
housekeeper
from
apartment
no
located
just
below
quant
s
apartment
at
khustov
s
it
was
pouring
from
the
ceiling
in
both
the
kitchen
and
the
toilet
finally
in
quant
s
kitchen
a
huge
slab
of
plaster
fell
from
the
ceiling
breaking
all
the
dirty
dishes
after
which
came
a
real
downpour
the
water
gushing
from
the
grid
of
wet
hanging
lath
as
if
from
a
bucket
then
on
the
steps
of
the
main
entrance
shouting
began
flying
past
the
penultimate
window
of
the
fourth
floor
margarita
peeked
in
and
saw
a
man
who
in
panic
had
pulled
on
a
gas
mask
hitting
his
window
with
the
hammer
margarita
scared
him
off
and
he
disappeared
from
the
room
and
unexpectedly
the
wild
havoc
ceased
slipping
down
to
the
third
floor
margarita
peeked
into
the
end
window
covered
by
a
thin
dark
little
curtain
in
the
room
a
little
lamp
was
burning
weakly
under
a
shade
in
a
small
bed
with
net
sides
sat
a
boy
of
about
four
listening
timorously
there
were
no
grownups
in
the
room
evidently
they
had
all
run
out
of
the
apartment
they
re
breaking
the
windows
the
boy
said
and
called
mama
no
one
answered
and
then
he
said
mama
i
m
afraid
margarita
drew
the
little
curtain
aside
and
flew
in
i
m
afraid
the
boy
repeated
and
trembled
don
t
be
afraid
don
t
be
afraid
little
one
said
margarita
trying
to
soften
her
criminal
voice
grown
husky
from
the
wind
it
s
some
boys
breaking
windows
with
a
slingshot
the
boy
asked
ceasing
to
tremble
with
a
slingshot
with
a
slingshot
margarita
confirmed
and
you
go
to
sleep
it
s
sitnik
said
the
boy
he
s
got
a
slingshot
well
of
course
it
s
he
the
boy
looked
slyly
somewhere
to
the
side
and
asked
and
where
are
you
ma
am
i
m
nowhere
answered
margarita
i
m
your
dream
i
thought
so
said
the
boy
lie
down
now
margarita
ordered
put
your
hand
under
your
cheek
and
i
ll
go
on
being
your
dream
well
be
my
dream
then
the
boy
agreed
and
at
once
lay
down
and
put
his
hand
under
his
cheek
i
ll
tell
you
a
story
margarita
began
and
placed
her
hot
hand
on
his
cropped
head
once
there
was
a
certain
lady
and
she
had
no
children
and
generally
no
happiness
either
and
so
first
she
cried
for
a
long
time
and
then
she
became
wicked
margarita
fell
silent
and
took
awayher
hand
the
boy
was
asleep
margarita
quietly
placed
the
hammer
on
the
windowsill
and
flew
out
the
window
there
was
turmoil
by
the
building
on
the
asphalt
pavement
strewn
with
broken
glass
people
were
running
and
shouting
something
policemen
were
already
flashing
among
them
suddenly
a
bell
rang
and
a
red
fireengine
with
a
ladder
drove
into
the
lane
from
the
arbat
but
what
followed
no
longer
interested
margarita
taking
aim
so
as
not
to
brush
against
any
wires
she
clutched
her
broom
more
tightly
and
in
a
moment
was
high
above
the
illfated
house
the
lane
beneath
her
went
askew
and
plunged
away
in
place
of
it
a
mass
of
roofs
appeared
under
margarita
s
feet
crisscrossed
at
various
angles
by
shining
paths
it
all
unexpectedly
went
off
to
one
side
and
the
strings
of
lights
smeared
and
merged
margarita
made
one
more
spurt
and
the
whole
mass
of
roofs
fell
through
the
earth
and
in
place
of
it
a
lake
of
quivering
electric
lights
appeared
below
and
this
lake
suddenly
rose
up
vertically
and
then
appeared
over
margarita
s
head
while
the
moon
flashed
under
her
feet
realizing
that
she
had
flipped
over
margarita
resumed
a
normal
position
and
glancing
back
saw
that
there
was
no
longer
any
lake
and
that
there
behind
her
only
a
pink
glow
remained
on
the
horizon
that
too
disappeared
a
second
later
and
margarita
saw
that
she
was
alone
with
the
moon
flying
above
and
to
the
left
of
her
margarita
s
hair
had
long
been
standing
up
in
a
shock
and
the
whistling
moonlight
bathed
her
body
seeing
two
rows
of
widespread
lights
merge
into
two
unbroken
fiery
lines
seeing
how
quickly
they
vanished
behind
her
margarita
realized
that
she
was
flying
at
an
enormous
speed
and
was
amazed
that
she
was
not
out
of
breath
after
a
few
seconds
a
new
glow
of
electric
lights
flared
up
far
below
in
the
earthly
blackness
and
hurtled
under
the
flying
woman
s
feet
but
immediately
spun
away
like
a
whirligig
and
fell
into
the
earth
a
few
seconds
later
exactly
the
same
phenomenon
towns
towns
cried
margarita
two
or
three
times
after
that
she
saw
dully
gleaming
sabres
lying
in
open
black
sheaths
below
her
and
realized
that
these
were
rivers
turning
her
head
up
and
to
the
left
the
flying
woman
admired
the
way
the
moon
madly
raced
back
over
her
towards
moscow
and
at
the
same
time
strangely
stayed
in
its
place
so
that
there
could
be
clearly
seen
on
it
something
mysterious
dark
a
dragon
or
a
little
humpbacked
horse
its
sharp
muzzle
turned
to
the
abandoned
city
here
the
thought
came
to
margarita
that
in
fact
there
was
no
need
for
her
to
drive
her
broom
so
furiously
that
she
was
depriving
herself
of
the
opportunity
of
seeing
anything
properly
of
revelling
properly
in
her
own
flight
something
told
her
that
she
would
be
waited
for
in
the
place
she
was
flying
to
and
that
there
was
no
need
for
her
to
become
bored
with
this
insane
speed
and
height
margarita
turned
the
broom
s
bristles
forward
so
that
its
tail
rose
up
and
slowing
way
down
headed
right
for
the
earth
this
downward
glide
as
on
an
airy
sled
gave
her
the
greatest
pleasure
the
earth
rose
to
meet
her
and
in
its
hitherto
formless
black
density
the
charms
and
secrets
of
the
earth
on
a
moonlit
night
revealed
themselves
the
earth
was
coming
to
her
and
margarita
was
already
enveloped
in
the
scent
of
greening
forests
margarita
was
flying
just
above
the
mists
of
a
dewy
meadow
then
over
a
pond
under
margarita
sang
a
chorus
of
frogs
and
from
somewhere
far
away
stirring
her
heart
deeply
for
some
reason
came
the
noise
of
a
train
soon
margarita
saw
it
it
was
crawling
slowly
along
like
a
caterpillar
spraying
sparks
into
the
air
going
ahead
of
it
margarita
passed
over
yet
another
watery
mirror
in
which
a
second
moon
floated
under
her
feet
dropped
down
lower
still
and
went
on
her
feetnearly
touching
the
tops
of
the
huge
pines
a
heavy
noise
of
ripping
air
came
from
behind
and
began
to
overtake
margarita
to
this
noise
of
something
flying
like
a
cannon
ball
a
woman
s
guffaw
was
gradually
added
audible
for
many
miles
around
margarita
looked
back
and
saw
some
complex
dark
object
catching
up
with
her
as
it
drew
nearer
to
margarita
it
became
more
distinct
a
mounted
flying
person
could
be
seen
and
finally
it
became
quite
distinct
slowing
down
natashacame
abreast
of
margarita
completely
naked
her
dishevelled
hair
flying
in
the
air
she
flew
astride
a
fat
hog
who
was
clutching
a
briefcase
in
his
front
hoofs
while
his
hind
hoofs
desperately
threshed
the
air
occasionally
gleaming
in
the
moonlight
then
fading
the
pincenez
that
had
fallen
off
his
nose
flew
beside
the
hog
on
a
string
and
the
hog
s
hat
kept
sliding
down
over
his
eyes
taking
a
close
look
margarita
recognized
the
hog
as
nikolai
ivanovich
and
then
her
laughter
rang
out
over
the
forest
mingled
with
the
laughter
of
natasha
natashka
margarita
shouted
piercingly
you
rubbed
yourself
with
the
cream
darling
natasha
replied
awakening
the
sleeping
pine
forest
with
her
shout

bald
head

tearfully

along
with
his
rider

natasha
riding
beside

began
jabbing
her
finger
into
the
neck
of
the
abashedly
huffing
hog
propositioned
me

was

me

shouted
leaning
towards
the
hog

ear

natasha
shouted
with
a
brazen
guffaw
please
natalya
prokofyevna
someone
may
hear
us
the
hog
yelled
imploringly
flying
beside
margarita
natasha
laughingly
told
her
what
happened
in
the
house
after
margarita
nikolaevna
flew
off
over
the
gates
natasha
confessed
that
without
ever
touching
any
of
the
things
she
had
been
given
she
threw
off
her
clothes
rushed
to
the
cream
and
immediately
smeared
herself
with
it
the
same
thing
happened
with
her
as
with
her
mistress
just
as
natasha
laughing
with
joy
was
revelling
in
her
own
magical
beauty
before
the
mirror
the
door
opened
and
nikolai
ivanovich
appeared
before
her
he
was
agitated
in
his
hands
he
was
holding
margarita
nikolaevna
s
shift
and
his
own
hat
and
briefcase
seeing
natasha
nikolai
ivanovich
was
dumbfounded
getting
some
control
of
himself
all
red
as
a
lobster
he
announced
that
he
felt
it
was
his
duty
to
pick
up
the
little
shift
and
bring
it
personally
the
things
he
said
the
blackguard
natasha
shrieked
and
laughed
the
things
he
said
the
things
he
tempted
me
to
do
the
money
he
promised
he
said
klavdia
petrovna
would
never
learn
of
it
well
speak
am
i
lying
natasha
shouted
to
the
hog
who
only
turned
his
muzzle
away
abashedly
in
the
bedroom
carried
away
with
her
own
mischief
natasha
dabbed
some
cream
on
nikolai
ivanovich
and
was
herself
struck
dumb
with
astonishment
the
respectable
groundfloor
tenant
s
face
shrank
to
a
pig
s
snout
and
his
hands
and
feet
acquired
little
hoofs
looking
at
himself
in
the
mirror
nikolai
ivanovich
let
out
a
wild
and
desperate
howl
but
it
was
already
too
late
a
few
seconds
later
saddled
up
he
was
flying
out
of
moscow
to
devil
knows
where
sobbing
with
grief
i
demand
that
my
normal
appearance
be
restored
to
me
the
hog
suddenly
grunted
hoarsely
somewhere
between
frenzy
and
supplication
i
m
not
going
to
fly
to
any
illegal
gathering
margarita
nikolaevna
it
s
your
duty
to
call
your
housekeeper
to
order
ah
so
now
i
m
a
housekeeper
a
housekeeper
natasha
cried
pinching
the
hog
s
ear
and
i
used
to
be
a
goddess
what
was
it
you
called
me
venus
the
hog
replied
tearfully
as
he
flew
over
a
brook
bubbling
between
stones
his
little
hoofs
brushing
the
hazel
bushes
venus
venus
natasha
cried
triumphantly
one
hand
on
her
hip
the
other
stretched
out
towards
the
moon
margarita
queen
intercede
for
me
so
that
i
can
stay
a
witch
they
ll
do
anything
for
you
you
have
been
granted
power
and
margarita
responded
all
right
i
promise
thank
you
exclaimed
natasha
and
suddenly
she
cried
out
sharply
and
somehow
longingly
hey
hey
faster
faster
come
on
speed
it
up
she
dug
her
heels
into
the
hog
s
sides
which
had
grown
thinner
during
this
insane
ride
and
he
tore
on
so
that
the
air
ripped
open
again
and
a
moment
later
natasha
could
be
seen
only
as
a
black
speck
in
the
distance
then
vanished
completely
and
the
noise
of
her
flight
melted
away
margarita
flew
as
slowly
as
before
through
the
deserted
and
unfamiliar
place
over
hills
strewn
with
occasional
boulders
among
huge
widely
spaced
pines
margarita
now
flew
not
over
the
tops
of
the
pines
but
between
their
trunks
silvered
on
one
side
by
the
moon
the
light
shadow
of
the
flying
woman
glided
over
the
ground
ahead
the
moon
shining
now
on
margarita
s
back
margarita
sensed
the
proximity
of
water
and
guessed
that
her
goal
was
near
the
pines
parted
and
margarita
rode
slowly
through
the
air
up
to
a
chalk
cliff
beyond
this
cliff
down
in
the
shadows
lay
a
river
mist
hung
clinging
to
the
bushes
on
the
cliff
but
the
opposite
bank
was
flat
and
low
on
it
under
a
solitary
group
of
spreading
trees
the
light
of
a
bonfire
flickered
and
some
small
figures
could
be
seen
moving
about
it
seemed
to
margarita
that
some
nagging
merry
little
tune
was
coming
from
there
further
off
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
there
was
no
sign
of
habitation
or
people
on
the
silvered
plain
margarita
leaped
off
the
cliff
and
quickly
descended
to
the
water
the
water
enticed
her
after
her
airy
race
casting
the
broom
aside
she
ran
and
threw
herself
head
first
into
the
water
her
light
body
pierced
the
water
s
surface
like
an
arrow
and
the
column
of
water
thrown
up
almost
reached
the
moon
the
water
turned
out
to
be
warm
as
in
a
bathhouse
and
emerging
from
the
depths
margarita
swam
her
fill
in
the
total
solitude
of
night
in
this
river
there
was
no
one
near
margarita
but
a
little
further
away
behind
the
bushes
splashing
and
grunting
could
be
heard
someone
was
also
having
a
swim
there
margarita
ran
out
on
to
the
bank
her
body
was
on
fire
after
the
swim
she
felt
no
fatigue
and
was
joyfully
capering
about
on
the
moist
grass
suddenly
she
stopped
dancing
and
pricked
up
her
ears
the
grunting
came
closer
and
from
behind
the
willow
bushes
some
naked
fat
man
emerged
with
a
black
silk
top
hat
pushed
back
on
his
head
his
feet
were
covered
with
slimy
mud
which
made
it
seem
that
the
swimmer
was
wearing
black
shoes
judging
by
his
huffing
and
hiccuping
he
was
properly
drunk
as
was
confirmed
incidentally
by
the
fact
that
the
river
suddenly
began
to
smell
of
cognac
seeing
margarita
the
fat
man
peered
at
her
and
then
shouted
joyfully
what
s
this
who
is
it
i
see
claudine
it
s
you
the
ungrieving
widow
you
re
here
too
and
he
came
at
her
with
his
greetings
margarita
stepped
back
and
replied
with
dignity
go
to
the
devil
what
sort
of
claudine
am
i
to
you
watch
out
who
you
re
talking
to
and
after
a
moment
s
reflection
she
added
to
her
words
a
long
unprintable
oath
all
this
had
a
sobering
effect
on
the
lightminded
fat
man
ah
he
exclaimed
softly
and
gave
a
start
magnanimously
forgive
me
bright
queen
margot
i
mistook
you
for
someone
else
the
cognac
s
to
blame
curse
it
the
fat
man
lowered
himself
to
one
knee
holding
the
top
hat
far
out
made
a
bow
and
started
to
prattle
mixing
russian
phrases
with
french
some
nonsense
about
the
bloody
wedding
of
his
friend
guessard
in
paris
and
about
the
cognac
and
about
being
mortified
by
his
sad
mistake
why
don
t
you
put
your
trousers
on
you
son
of
a
bitch
margarita
said
softening
the
fat
man
grinned
joyfully
seeing
that
margarita
was
not
angry
and
rapturously
declared
that
he
found
himself
without
trousers
at
the
given
moment
only
because
in
his
absentmindedness
he
had
left
them
on
the
yenisey
river
where
he
had
been
swimming
just
before
but
that
he
would
presently
fly
there
since
it
was
close
at
hand
and
then
entrusting
himself
to
her
favour
and
patronage
he
began
to
back
away
and
went
on
backing
away
until
he
slipped
and
fell
backwards
into
the
water
but
even
as
he
fell
he
kept
on
his
face
framed
in
small
sidewhiskers
a
smile
of
rapture
and
devotion
here
margarita
gave
a
piercing
whistle
and
mounting
the
broom
that
flew
up
to
her
crossed
to
the
opposite
bank
of
the
river
the
shadow
of
the
chalk
mountain
did
not
reach
that
far
and
the
whole
bank
was
flooded
with
moonlight
as
soon
as
margarita
touched
the
moist
grass
the
music
under
the
pussy
willows
struck
up
louder
and
a
sheaf
of
sparks
flew
up
more
merrily
from
the
bonfire
under
the
pussywillow
branches
strewn
with
tender
fluffy
catkins
visible
in
the
moonlight
sat
two
rows
of
fatfaced
frogs
puffing
up
as
if
they
were
made
of
rubber
playing
a
bravura
march
on
wooden
pipes
glowing
marshlights
hung
on
willow
twigs
in
front
of
the
musicians
lighting
up
the
music
the
restless
light
of
the
bonfire
danced
on
the
frogs
faces
the
march
was
being
played
in
honour
of
margarita
she
was
given
a
most
solemn
reception
transparent
naiads
stopped
their
round
dance
over
the
river
and
waved
weeds
at
margarita
and
their
faraudible
greetings
moaned
across
the
deserted
greenish
bank
naked
witches
jumping
from
behind
the
pussy
willows
formed
a
line
and
began
curtseying
and
making
courtly
bows
someone
goatlegged
flew
up
and
bent
to
her
hand
spread
silk
on
the
grass
inquired
whether
the
queen
had
had
a
good
swim
and
invited
her
to
lie
down
and
rest
margarita
did
just
that
the
goatlegged
one
offered
her
a
glass
of
champagne
she
drank
it
and
her
heart
became
warm
at
once
having
inquired
about
natasha
s
whereabouts
she
received
the
reply
that
natasha
had
already
taken
her
swim
and
had
flown
ahead
to
moscow
on
her
hog
to
warn
them
that
margarita
would
soon
arrive
and
to
help
prepare
her
attire
margarita
s
short
stay
under
the
pussy
willows
was
marked
by
one
episode
there
was
a
whistling
in
the
air
and
a
black
body
obviously
missing
its
mark
dropped
into
the
water
a
few
moments
later
there
stood
before
margarita
that
same
fat
sidewhiskerist
who
had
so
unsuccessfully
introduced
himself
on
the
other
bank
he
had
apparently
managed
to
get
to
the
yenisey
and
back
for
he
was
in
full
evening
dress
though
wet
from
head
to
foot
the
cognac
had
done
him
another
bad
turn
as
he
came
down
he
landed
in
the
water
after
all
but
he
did
not
lose
his
smile
even
on
this
lamentable
occasion
and
the
laughing
margarita
admitted
him
to
her
hand
then
they
all
started
getting
ready
the
naiads
finished
their
dance
in
the
moonlight
and
melted
into
it
the
goatlegged
one
deferentially
inquired
of
margarita
how
she
had
come
to
the
river
on
learning
that
she
had
come
riding
on
a
broom
he
said
oh
but
why
it
s
so
inconvenient
he
instantly
slapped
together
some
dubiouslooking
telephone
from
two
twigs
and
demanded
of
someone
that
a
car
be
sent
that
very
minute
which
that
same
minute
was
actually
done
an
open
light
sorrel
car
came
down
on
the
island
only
in
the
driver
s
seat
there
sat
no
ordinarylooking
driver
but
a
black
longbeaked
rook
in
an
oilcloth
cap
and
gauntlets
the
little
island
was
becoming
deserted
the
witches
flew
off
melting
into
the
moonblaze
the
bonfire
was
dying
down
and
the
coals
were
covering
over
with
hoary
ash
the
goatlegged
one
helped
margarita
in
and
she
sank
on
to
the
wide
back
seat
of
the
sorrel
car
the
car
roared
sprang
up
and
climbed
almost
to
the
moon
the
island
vanished
the
river
vanished
margarita
was
racing
to
moscow
chapter
by
candlelight
the
steady
humming
of
the
car
flying
high
above
the
earth
lulled
margarita
and
the
moonlight
warmed
her
pleasantly
closing
her
eyes
she
offered
her
face
to
the
wind
and
thought
with
a
certain
sadness
about
the
unknown
river
bank
she
had
left
behind
which
she
sensed
she
would
never
see
again
after
all
the
sorceries
and
wonders
of
that
evening
she
could
already
guess
precisely
whom
she
was
being
taken
to
visit
but
that
did
not
frighten
her
the
hope
that
there
she
would
manage
to
regain
her
happiness
made
her
fearless
however
she
was
not
to
dream
of
this
happiness
for
long
in
the
car
either
the
rook
knew
his
job
well
or
the
car
was
a
good
one
but
margarita
soon
opened
her
eyes
and
saw
beneath
her
not
the
forest
darkness
but
a
quivering
sea
of
moscow
lights
the
black
birddriver
unscrewed
the
right
front
wheel
in
flight
then
landed
the
car
in
some
completely
deserted
cemetery
in
the
dorogomilovo
area
having
deposited
the
unquestioning
margarita
by
one
of
the
graves
along
with
her
broom
the
rook
started
the
car
aiming
it
straight
into
the
ravine
beyond
the
cemetery
it
tumbled
noisily
into
it
and
there
perished
the
rook
saluted
deferentially
mounted
the
wheel
and
flew
off
a
black
cloak
appeared
at
once
from
behind
one
of
the
tombstones
a
fang
flashed
in
the
moonlight
and
margarita
recognized
azazello
he
gestured
to
margarita
inviting
her
to
get
on
the
broom
jumped
on
to
a
long
rapier
himself
they
both
whirled
up
and
in
a
few
seconds
unnoticed
by
anyone
landed
near
no
bis
on
sadovaya
street
when
the
companions
passed
through
the
gateway
carrying
the
broom
and
rapier
under
their
arms
margarita
noticed
a
man
languishing
there
in
a
cap
and
high
boots
probably
waiting
for
someone
light
though
azazello
s
and
margarita
s
footsteps
were
the
solitary
man
heard
them
and
twitched
uneasily
not
understanding
who
had
produced
them
by
the
sixth
entrance
they
met
a
second
man
looking
surprisingly
like
the
first
and
again
the
same
story
repeated
itself
footsteps
the
man
turned
and
frowned
uneasily
and
when
the
door
opened
and
closed
he
dashed
after
the
invisible
enterers
peeked
into
the
front
hall
but
of
course
saw
nothing
a
third
man
the
exact
copy
of
the
second
and
therefore
also
of
the
first
stood
watch
on
the
thirdfloor
landing
he
smoked
strong
cigarettes
and
margarita
had
a
fit
of
coughing
as
she
walked
past
him
the
smoker
as
if
pricked
with
a
pin
jumped
up
from
the
bench
he
was
sitting
on
began
turning
around
uneasily
went
to
the
banister
looked
down
margarita
and
her
companion
were
by
that
time
already
at
the
door
of
apartment
no
they
did
not
ring
the
bell
azazello
noiselessly
opened
the
door
with
his
own
key
the
first
thing
that
struck
margarita
was
the
darkness
in
which
she
found
herself
it
was
as
dark
as
underground
so
that
she
involuntarily
clutched
at
azazello
s
cloak
for
fear
of
stumbling
but
then
from
far
away
and
above
the
light
of
some
little
lamp
flickered
and
began
to
approach
azazello
took
the
broom
from
under
margarita
s
arm
as
they
walked
and
it
disappeared
without
a
sound
in
the
darkness
here
they
started
climbing
some
wide
steps
and
margarita
began
to
think
there
would
be
no
end
to
them
she
was
struck
that
the
front
hall
of
an
ordinary
moscow
apartment
could
contain
this
extraordinary
invisible
yet
quite
palpable
endless
stairway
but
the
climb
ended
and
margarita
realized
that
she
was
on
a
landing
the
light
came
right
up
to
them
and
margarita
saw
in
this
light
the
face
of
a
man
long
and
black
holding
a
little
lamp
in
his
hand
those
who
in
recent
days
had
been
so
unfortunate
as
to
cross
paths
with
him
would
certainly
have
recognized
him
even
by
the
faint
tongue
of
flame
from
the
lamp
it
was
koroviev
alias
fagott
true
koroviev
s
appearance
was
quite
changed
the
flickering
light
was
reflected
not
in
the
cracked
pincenez
which
it
had
long
been
time
to
throw
in
the
trash
but
in
a
monocle
which
true
was
also
cracked
the
little
moustache
on
his
insolent
face
was
twirled
up
and
waxed
and
koroviev
s
blackness
was
quite
simply
explained
he
was
in
formal
attire
only
his
chest
was
white
the
magician
choirmaster
sorcerer
interpreter
devil
knows
what
he
really
was
koroviev
in
short
made
his
bows
and
with
a
broad
sweep
of
the
lamp
in
the
air
invited
margarita
to
follow
him
azazello
disappeared
an
amazingly
strange
evening
thought
margarita
i
expected
anything
but
this
has
their
electricity
gone
off
or
what
but
the
most
striking
thing
is
the
size
of
the
place
how
could
it
all
be
squeezed
into
a
moscow
apartment
there
s
simply
no
way
it
could
be
however
little
light
koroviev
s
lamp
gave
out
margarita
realized
that
she
was
in
an
absolutely
enormous
hall
with
a
colonnade
besides
dark
and
on
first
impression
endless
koroviev
stopped
by
some
sort
of
little
settee
placed
his
lamp
on
some
sort
of
post
gestured
for
margarita
to
sit
down
and
settled
himself
beside
her
in
a
picturesque
attitude
leaning
his
elbow
on
the
post
allow
me
to
introduce
myself
to
you
creaked
koroviev
koroviev
you
are
surprised
there
s
no
light
economy
so
you
think
of
course
unhunh
may
the
first
executioner
to
come
along
even
one
of
those
who
later
this
evening
will
have
the
honour
of
kissing
your
knee
lop
my
head
off
on
this
very
post
if
it
s
so
messire
simply
doesn
t
like
electric
light
and
we
ll
save
it
for
the
very
last
moment
and
then
believe
me
there
ll
be
no
lack
of
it
perhaps
it
would
even
be
better
to
have
less
margarita
liked
koroviev
and
his
rattling
chatter
had
a
soothing
effect
on
her
no
replied
margarita
most
of
all
i
m
struck
that
there
s
room
for
all
this
she
made
a
gesture
with
her
hand
emphasizing
the
enormousness
of
the
hall
koroviev
grinned
sweetly
which
made
the
shadows
stir
in
the
folds
of
his
nose
the
most
uncomplicated
thing
of
all
he
replied
for
someone
well
acquainted
with
the
fifth
dimension
it
costs
nothing
to
expand
space
to
the
desired
proportions
i
ll
say
more
respected
lady
to
devil
knows
what
proportions
i
however
koroviev
went
on
chattering
have
knownpeople
who
had
no
idea
not
only
of
the
fifth
dimension
but
generally
of
anything
at
all
and
who
nevertheless
performed
absolute
wonders
in
expanding
their
space
thus
for
instance
one
citydweller
as
i
ve
been
told
having
obtained
a
threeroom
apartment
on
zemlyanoy
val
transformed
it
instantly
without
any
fifth
dimension
or
other
things
that
addle
the
brain
into
a
fourroom
apartment
by
dividing
one
room
in
half
with
a
partition
he
forthwith
exchanged
that
one
for
two
separate
apartments
in
different
parts
of
moscow
one
of
three
rooms
the
other
of
two
you
must
agree
that
that
makes
five
the
threeroom
one
he
exchanged
for
two
separate
ones
each
of
two
rooms
and
became
the
owner
as
you
can
see
for
yourself
of
sixrooms
true
scattered
in
total
disorder
all
over
moscow
he
was
just
getting
ready
to
perform
his
last
and
most
brilliant
leap
by
advertising
in
the
newspapers
that
he
wanted
to
exchange
six
rooms
in
different
parts
of
moscow
for
one
fiveroom
apartment
on
zemlyanoy
val
when
his
activity
ceased
for
reasons
independent
of
him
he
probably
also
has
some
sort
of
room
now
only
i
venture
to
assure
you
it
is
not
in
moscow
a
real
slicker
you
see
ma
am
and
you
keep
talking
about
the
fifth
dimension
though
she
had
never
talked
about
the
fifth
dimension
and
it
was
koroviev
himself
who
kept
talking
about
it
margarita
laughed
gaily
hearing
the
story
of
the
adventures
of
the
apartment
slicker
koroviev
went
on
but
to
business
to
business
margarita
nikolaevna
you
re
quite
an
intelligent
woman
and
of
course
have
already
guessed
who
our
host
is
margarita
s
heart
thumped
and
she
nodded
well
and
so
ma
am
koroviev
said
and
so
we
re
enemies
of
any
sort
of
reticence
and
mysteriousness
messire
gives
one
ball
annually
it
is
called
the
spring
ball
of
the
full
moon
or
the
ball
of
the
hundred
kings
such
a
crowd
here
koroviev
held
his
cheek
as
if
he
had
a
toothache
however
i
hope
you
ll
be
convinced
of
it
yourself
now
messire
is
a
bachelor
as
you
yourself
of
course
understand
yet
a
hostess
is
needed
koroviev
spread
his
arms
without
a
hostess
you
must
agree
margarita
listened
to
koroviev
trying
not
to
miss
a
single
word
she
felt
cold
under
her
heart
the
hope
of
happiness
made
her
head
spin
the
tradition
has
been
established
koroviev
said
further
that
the
hostess
of
the
ball
must
without
fail
be
named
margarita
first
and
second
she
must
be
a
native
of
the
place
and
we
you
will
kindly
note
are
travelling
and
at
the
present
moment
are
in
moscow
we
found
one
hundred
andtwentyone
margaritas
in
moscow
and
would
you
believe
it
here
koroviev
slapped
himself
on
the
thigh
with
despair
not
one
of
them
was
suitable
and
at
last
by
a
happy
fate
koroviev
grinned
expressively
inclining
his
body
and
again
margarita
s
heart
went
cold
in
short
koroviev
cried
out
quite
shortly
you
won
t
refuse
to
take
this
responsibility
upon
yourself
i
won
t
refuse
margarita
replied
firmly
done
said
koroviev
and
raising
the
little
lamp
added
please
follow
me
they
walked
between
the
columns
and
finally
came
to
another
hall
in
which
for
some
reason
there
was
a
strong
smell
of
lemons
where
some
rustlings
were
heard
and
something
brushed
against
margarita
s
head
she
gave
a
start
don
t
be
frightened
koroviev
reassured
her
sweetly
taking
margarita
under
the
arm
it
s
behemoth
s
contrivances
for
the
ball
that
s
all
and
generally
i
will
allow
myself
the
boldness
of
advising
you
margarita
nikolaevna
never
to
be
afraid
of
anything
it
is
unreasonable
the
ball
will
be
a
magnificent
one
i
will
not
conceal
it
from
you
we
will
see
persons
the
scope
of
whose
power
in
their
own
time
was
extremely
great
but
really
once
you
think
how
microscopically
small
their
possibilities
were
compared
to
those
of
him
to
whose
retinue
i
have
the
honour
of
belongingit
seems
ridiculous
and
even
i
would
say
sad
and
besides
you
are
of
royal
blood
yourself
why
of
royal
blood
margarita
whispered
fearfully
pressing
herself
to
koroviev
ah
my
queen
koroviev
rattled
on
playfully
questions
of
blood
are
the
most
complicated
questions
in
the
world
and
if
we
were
to
question
certain
greatgrandmothers
especially
those
who
enjoyed
a
reputation
as
shrinking
violets
the
most
astonishing
secrets
would
be
uncovered
my
respected
margarita
nikolaevna
i
would
not
be
sinning
in
the
least
if
in
speaking
of
that
i
should
make
reference
to
a
whimsically
shuffled
pack
of
cards
there
are
things
in
which
neither
barriers
of
rank
nor
even
the
borders
between
countries
have
any
validity
whatsoever
a
hint
one
of
the
french
queens
who
lived
in
the
sixteenth
century
would
one
must
suppose
be
very
amazed
if
someone
told
her
that
after
all
these
years
i
would
be
leading
her
lovely
greatgreatgreatgranddaughter
on
my
arm
through
the
ballrooms
of
moscow
but
we
ve
arrived
here
koroviev
blew
out
his
lamp
and
it
vanished
from
his
hands
and
margarita
saw
lying
on
the
floor
in
front
of
her
a
streak
of
light
under
some
dark
door
and
on
this
door
koroviev
softly
knocked
here
margarita
became
so
agitated
that
her
teeth
chattered
and
a
chill
ran
down
her
spine
the
door
opened
the
room
turned
out
to
be
very
small
margarita
saw
a
wide
oak
bed
with
dirty
rumpled
and
bunchedup
sheets
and
pillows
before
the
bed
was
an
oak
table
with
carved
legs
on
which
stood
a
candelabrum
with
sockets
in
the
form
of
a
bird
s
claws
in
these
seven
golden
claws
burned
thick
wax
candles
besides
that
there
was
on
the
table
a
large
chessboard
with
pieces
of
extraordinarily
artful
workmanship
a
little
low
bench
stood
on
a
small
shabby
rug
there
was
yet
another
table
with
some
golden
bowl
and
another
candelabrum
with
branches
in
the
form
of
snakes
the
room
smelled
of
sulphur
and
pitch
shadows
from
the
lights
crisscrossed
on
the
floor
among
those
present
margarita
immediately
recognized
azazello
now
dressed
in
a
tailcoat
and
standing
at
the
head
of
the
bed
the
dressedup
azazello
no
longer
resembled
that
bandit
in
whose
form
he
had
appeared
to
margarita
in
the
alexandrovsky
garden
and
his
bow
to
margarita
was
very
gallant
a
naked
witch
that
same
hella
who
had
so
embarrassed
the
respectable
barman
of
the
variety
and
alas
the
same
who
had
so
fortunately
been
scared
off
by
the
cock
on
the
night
of
the
notorious
seance
sat
on
a
rug
on
the
floor
by
the
bed
stirring
something
in
a
pot
which
gave
off
a
sulphurous
steam
besides
these
there
was
also
a
huge
black
tomcat
in
the
room
sitting
on
a
high
tabouret
before
the
chess
table
holding
a
chess
knight
in
his
right
paw
hella
rose
and
bowed
to
margarita
the
cat
jumping
off
the
tabouret
did
likewise
scraping
with
his
right
hind
paw
he
dropped
the
knight
and
crawled
under
the
bed
after
it
margarita
sinking
with
fear
nevertheless
made
all
this
out
by
the
perfidious
candlelight
her
eyes
were
drawn
to
the
bed
on
which
sat
he
whom
still
quite
recently
at
the
patriarch
s
ponds
poor
ivan
had
tried
to
convince
that
the
devil
does
not
exist
it
was
this
nonexistent
one
who
was
sitting
on
the
bed
two
eyes
were
fixed
on
margarita
s
face
the
right
one
with
a
golden
spark
at
its
bottom
drilling
anyone
to
the
bottom
of
his
soul
and
the
left
one
empty
and
black
like
the
narrow
eye
of
a
needle
like
the
entrance
to
the
bottomless
well
of
all
darkness
and
shadow
woland
s
face
was
twisted
to
one
side
the
right
corner
ofthe
mouth
drawn
down
the
high
bald
forehead
scored
by
deep
wrinkles
running
parallel
to
the
sharp
eyebrows
the
skin
of
woland
s
face
was
as
if
burned
for
all
eternity
by
the
sun
woland
broadly
sprawled
on
the
bed
was
wearing
nothing
but
a
long
nightshirt
dirty
and
patched
on
the
left
shoulder
one
bare
leg
was
tucked
under
him
the
other
was
stretched
out
on
the
little
bench
it
was
the
knee
of
this
dark
leg
that
hella
was
rubbing
with
some
smoking
ointment
margarita
also
made
out
on
woland
s
bared
hairless
chest
a
beetle
artfully
carved
from
dark
stone
on
a
gold
chain
and
with
some
inscriptions
on
its
back
beside
woland
on
a
heavy
stand
stood
a
strange
globe
as
if
alive
lit
on
one
side
by
the
sun
the
silence
lasted
a
few
seconds
he
s
studying
me
thought
margarita
and
with
an
effort
of
will
she
tried
to
control
the
trembling
in
her
legs
at
last
woland
began
to
speak
smiling
which
made
his
sparkling
eye
as
if
to
flare
up
greetings
to
you
queen
and
i
beg
you
to
excuse
my
homely
attire
the
voice
of
woland
was
so
low
that
on
some
syllables
it
drew
out
into
a
wheeze
woland
took
a
long
sword
from
the
sheets
leaned
down
poked
it
under
the
bed
and
said
out
with
you
the
game
is
cancelled
the
guest
has
arrived
by
no
means
koroviev
anxiously
piped
prompterlike
at
margarita
s
ear
by
no
means
began
margarita
messire
koroviev
breathed
into
her
ear
by
no
means
messire
margarita
replied
softly
but
distinctly
gaining
control
over
herself
and
she
added
with
a
smile
i
beg
you
not
to
interrupt
your
game
i
imagine
the
chess
journals
would
pay
good
money
for
the
chance
to
publish
it
azazello
gave
a
low
but
approving
grunt
and
woland
looking
intently
at
margarita
observed
as
if
to
himself
yes
koroviev
is
right
how
whimsically
the
deck
has
been
shuffled
blood
he
reached
out
and
beckoned
margarita
to
him
with
his
hand
she
went
up
not
feeling
the
floor
under
her
bare
feet
woland
placed
his
hand
heavy
as
if
made
of
stone
and
at
the
same
time
hot
as
fire
on
margarita
s
shoulder
pulled
her
towards
him
and
sat
her
on
the
bed
by
his
side
well
he
said
since
you
are
so
charmingly
courteous
and
i
expected
nothing
else
let
us
not
stand
on
ceremony
he
again
leaned
over
the
side
of
the
bed
and
cried
how
long
will
this
circus
under
the
bed
continue
come
out
you
confounded
hans
i
can
t
find
my
knight
the
cat
responded
from
under
the
bed
in
a
muffled
and
false
voice
it
s
ridden
off
somewhere
and
i
keep
getting
some
frog
instead
you
don
t
imagine
you
re
at
some
fairground
do
you
asked
woland
pretending
to
be
angry
there
s
no
frog
under
the
bed
leave
these
cheap
tricks
for
the
variety
if
you
don
t
appear
at
once
well
consider
that
you
ve
forfeited
you
damned
deserter
not
for
anything
messire
yelled
the
cat
and
he
got
out
from
under
the
bed
that
same
second
holding
the
knight
in
his
paw
allow
me
to
present
woland
began
and
interrupted
himself
no
i
simply
cannot
look
at
this
buffoon
see
what
he
s
turned
himself
into
under
the
bed
standing
on
his
hind
legs
the
dustcovered
cat
was
meanwhile
making
his
bows
to
margarita
there
was
now
a
white
bowtie
on
the
cat
s
neck
and
a
pair
of
ladies
motherofpearl
opera
glasses
hung
from
a
strap
on
his
neck
what
s
more
the
cat
s
whiskers
were
gilded
well
what
s
all
this
now
exclaimed
woland
why
have
you
gilded
your
whiskers
and
what
the
devil
do
you
need
the
bowtie
for
when
you
re
not
even
wearing
trousers
a
cat
is
not
supposed
to
wear
trousers
messire
the
cat
replied
with
great
dignity
you
re
not
going
to
tell
me
to
wear
boots
too
are
you
pussinboots
exists
only
in
fairy
tales
messire
but
have
you
ever
seen
anyone
at
a
ball
without
a
bowtie
i
do
not
intend
to
put
myself
in
a
ridiculous
situation
and
risk
being
chucked
out
everyone
adorns
himself
with
what
he
can
you
may
consider
what
i
ve
said
as
referring
to
the
opera
glasses
as
well
messire
but
the
whiskers
i
don
t
understand
the
cat
retorted
drily
why
could
azazello
and
koroviev
put
white
powder
on
themselves
as
they
were
shaving
today
and
how
is
that
better
than
gold
i
powdered
my
whiskers
that
s
all
if
i
d
shaved
myself
it
would
be
a
different
matter
a
shaved
cat
now
that
is
indeed
an
outrage
i
m
prepared
to
admit
it
a
thousand
times
over
but
generally
here
the
cat
s
voice
quavered
touchily
i
see
i
am
being
made
the
object
of
a
certain
captiousness
and
i
see
that
a
serious
problem
stands
before
me
am
i
to
attend
the
ball
what
have
you
to
say
about
that
messire
and
the
cat
got
so
puffed
up
with
offence
that
it
seemed
he
would
burst
in
another
second
ah
the
cheat
the
cheat
said
woland
shaking
his
head
each
time
his
game
is
in
a
hopeless
situation
he
starts
addling
your
pate
like
the
crudest
mountebank
on
a
street
comer
sit
down
at
once
and
stop
slinging
this
verbal
muck
i
shall
sit
down
replied
the
cat
sitting
down
but
i
shall
enter
an
objection
with
regard
to
your
last
my
speeches
in
no
way
resemble
verbal
muck
as
you
have
been
pleased
to
put
it
in
the
presence
of
a
lady
but
rather
a
sequence
of
tightly
packed
syllogisms
the
merit
of
which
would
be
appreciated
by
such
connoisseurs
as
sextus
empiricus
martianus
capella
and
for
all
i
know
aristotle
himself
your
king
is
in
check
said
woland
very
well
very
well
responded
the
cat
and
he
began
studying
the
chessboard
through
his
opera
glasses
and
so
donna
woland
addressed
margarita
i
present
to
you
my
retinue
this
one
who
is
playing
the
fool
is
the
cat
behemoth
azazello
and
koroviev
you
have
already
met
i
present
to
you
my
maidservant
hella
efficient
quick
and
there
is
no
service
she
cannot
render
the
beautiful
hella
was
smiling
as
she
turned
her
greentinged
eyes
to
margarita
without
ceasing
to
dip
into
the
ointment
and
apply
it
to
woland
s
knee
well
that
s
the
lot
woland
concluded
wincing
as
hella
pressed
especially
hard
on
his
knee
a
small
mixed
and
guileless
company
as
you
see
he
fell
silent
and
began
to
spin
the
globe
in
front
of
him
which
was
so
artfully
made
that
the
blue
oceans
moved
on
it
and
the
cap
at
the
pole
lay
like
a
real
cap
of
ice
and
snow
on
the
chessboard
meanwhile
confusion
was
setting
in
a
thoroughly
upset
king
in
a
white
mantle
was
shuffling
on
his
square
desperately
raising
his
arms
three
white
pawnmercenaries
with
halberds
gazed
in
perplexity
at
the
bishop
brandishing
his
crozier
and
pointing
forward
to
where
on
two
adjacent
squares
white
and
black
woland
s
black
horsemen
could
be
seen
on
two
fiery
chargers
pawing
the
squares
with
their
hoofs
margarita
was
extremely
interested
and
struck
by
the
fact
that
the
chessmen
were
alive
the
cat
taking
the
opera
glasses
from
his
eyes
prodded
his
king
lightly
in
the
back
the
king
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
in
despair
things
aren
t
so
great
my
dear
behemoth
koroviev
said
quietly
in
a
venomous
voice
the
situation
is
serious
but
by
no
means
hopeless
behemoth
responded
what
s
more
i
m
quite
certain
of
final
victory
once
i
ve
analysed
the
situation
properly
he
set
about
this
analysing
in
a
rather
strange
manner
namely
by
winking
and
making
all
sorts
of
faces
at
his
king
nothing
helps
observed
koroviev
aie
cried
behemoth
the
parrots
have
flown
away
just
as
i
predicted
indeed
from
somewhere
far
away
came
the
noise
of
many
wings
koroviev
and
azazello
rushed
out
of
the
room
devil
take
you
with
your
ball
amusements
woland
grunted
without
tearing
his
eyes
from
his
globe
as
soon
as
koroviev
and
azazello
disappeared
behemoth
s
winking
took
on
greater
dimensions
the
white
king
finally
understood
what
was
wanted
of
him
he
suddenly
pulled
off
his
mantle
dropped
it
on
the
square
and
ran
off
the
board
the
bishop
covered
himself
with
the
abandoned
royal
garb
and
took
the
king
s
place
koroviev
and
azazello
came
back
lies
as
usual
grumbled
azazello
with
a
sidelong
glance
at
behemoth
i
thought
i
heard
it
replied
the
cat
well
is
this
going
to
continue
for
long
asked
woland
your
king
is
in
check
i
must
have
heard
wrong
my
master
replied
the
cat
my
king
is
not
and
cannot
be
in
check
i
repeat
your
king
is
in
check
messire
the
cat
responded
in
a
falsely
alarmed
voice
you
are
overtired
my
king
is
not
in
check
the
king
is
on
square
g
said
woland
without
looking
at
the
board
messire
i
m
horrified
howled
the
cat
showing
horror
on
his
mug
there
is
no
king
on
that
square
what
s
that
woland
asked
in
perplexity
and
began
looking
at
the
board
where
the
bishop
standing
on
the
king
s
square
kept
turning
away
and
hiding
behind
his
hand
ah
you
scoundrel
woland
said
pensively
messire
again
i
appeal
to
logic
the
cat
began
pressing
his
paws
to
his
chest
if
a
player
announces
that
the
king
is
in
check
and
meanwhile
there
s
no
trace
of
the
king
on
the
board
the
check
must
be
recognized
as
invalid
do
you
give
up
or
not
woland
cried
in
a
terrible
voice
let
me
think
it
over
the
cat
replied
humbly
resting
his
elbows
on
the
table
putting
his
paws
over
his
ears
and
beginning
to
think
he
thought
for
a
long
time
and
finally
said
i
give
up
the
obstinate
beast
should
be
killed
whispered
azazello
yes
i
give
up
said
the
cat
but
i
do
so
only
because
i
am
unable
to
play
in
an
atmosphere
of
persecution
on
the
part
of
the
envious
he
stood
up
and
the
chessmen
climbed
into
their
box
hella
it
s
time
said
woland
and
hella
disappeared
from
the
room
my
leg
hurts
and
now
this
ball
he
continued
allow
me
margarita
quietly
asked
woland
looked
at
her
intently
and
moved
his
knee
towards
her
the
liquid
hot
as
lava
burned
her
hands
but
margarita
without
wincing
and
trying
not
to
cause
any
pain
rubbed
it
into
his
knee
my
attendants
insist
it
s
rheumatism
woland
was
saying
not
taking
his
eyes
off
margarita
but
i
strongly
suspect
that
this
pain
in
my
knee
was
left
me
as
a
souvenir
by
a
charming
witch
with
whom
i
was
closely
acquainted
in
the
year
on
mount
brocken
on
the
devil
s
podium
ah
can
that
be
so
said
margarita
nonsense
in
another
three
hundred
years
it
will
all
go
away
i
ve
been
recommended
a
host
of
medications
but
i
keep
to
my
granny
s
old
ways
amazing
herbs
she
left
me
my
grandam
that
vile
old
thing
incidentally
tell
me
are
you
suffering
from
anything
perhaps
you
have
some
sort
of
sorrow
or
soulpoisoning
anguish
no
messire
none
of
that
replied
the
clever
margarita
and
now
that
i
m
here
with
you
i
feel
myself
quite
well
blood
is
a
great
thing
woland
said
gaily
with
no
obvious
point
and
added
i
see
you
re
interested
in
my
globe
oh
yes
i
ve
never
seen
anything
like
it
it
s
a
nice
little
object
frankly
speaking
i
don
t
enjoy
listening
to
the
news
on
the
radio
it
s
always
reported
by
some
girls
who
pronounce
the
names
of
places
inarticulately
besides
every
third
one
has
some
slight
speech
defect
as
if
they
re
chosen
on
purpose
my
globe
is
much
more
convenient
especially
since
i
need
a
precise
knowledge
of
events
for
instance
do
you
see
this
chunk
of
land
washed
on
one
side
by
the
ocean
look
it
s
filling
with
fire
a
war
has
started
there
if
you
look
closer
you
ll
see
the
details
margarita
leaned
towards
the
globe
and
saw
the
little
square
of
land
spread
out
get
painted
in
many
colours
and
turn
as
it
were
into
a
relief
map
and
then
she
saw
the
little
ribbon
of
a
river
and
some
village
near
it
a
little
house
the
size
of
a
pea
grew
and
became
the
size
of
a
matchbox
suddenly
and
noiselessly
the
roof
of
this
house
flew
up
along
with
a
cloud
of
black
smoke
and
the
walls
collapsed
so
that
nothing
was
left
of
the
little
twostorey
box
except
a
small
heap
with
black
smoke
pouring
from
it
bringing
her
eye
still
closer
margarita
made
out
a
small
female
figure
lying
on
the
ground
and
next
to
her
in
a
pool
of
blood
a
little
child
with
outstretched
arms
that
s
it
woland
said
smiling
he
had
no
time
to
sin
abaddon
s
work
is
impeccable
i
wouldn
t
want
to
be
on
the
side
that
this
abaddon
is
against
said
margarita
whose
side
is
he
on
the
longer
i
talk
with
you
woland
responded
amiably
the
more
i
m
convinced
that
you
are
very
intelligent
i
ll
set
you
at
ease
he
is
of
a
rare
impartiality
and
sympathizes
equally
with
both
sides
of
the
fight
owing
to
that
the
results
are
always
the
same
for
both
sides
abaddon
woland
called
in
a
low
voice
and
here
there
emerged
from
the
wall
the
figure
of
some
gaunt
man
in
dark
glasses
these
glasses
produced
such
a
strong
impression
on
margarita
that
she
cried
out
softly
and
hid
her
face
in
woland
s
leg
ah
stop
it
cried
woland
modern
people
are
so
nervous
he
swung
and
slapped
margarita
on
the
back
so
that
a
ringing
went
through
her
whole
body
don
t
you
see
he
s
got
his
glasses
on
besides
there
has
never
yet
been
and
never
will
be
an
occasion
when
abaddon
appears
before
someone
prematurely
and
finally
i
m
here
you
are
my
guest
i
simply
wanted
to
show
him
to
you
abaddon
stood
motionless
and
is
it
possible
for
him
to
take
off
his
glasses
for
a
second
margarita
asked
pressing
herself
to
woland
and
shuddering
but
now
from
curiosity
ah
no
that
s
impossible
woland
replied
seriously
and
waved
his
hand
at
abaddon
and
he
was
no
more
what
do
you
wish
to
say
azazello
messire
replied
azazello
allow
me
to
say
we
ve
got
two
strangers
here
a
beauty
who
is
whimpering
and
pleading
to
be
allowed
to
stay
with
her
lady
and
with
her
begging
your
pardon
there
is
also
her
hog
strange
behaviour
for
a
beauty
observed
woland
it
s
natasha
natasha
exclaimed
margarita
well
let
her
stay
with
her
lady
and
the
hog
to
the
cooks
to
slaughter
him
margarita
cried
fearfully
for
pity
s
sake
messire
it
s
nikolai
ivanovich
the
groundfloor
tenant
it
s
a
misunderstanding
you
see
she
daubed
him
with
the
cream
but
wait
said
woland
why
the
devil
would
anyone
slaughter
him
let
him
stay
with
the
cooks
that
s
all
you
must
agree
i
cannot
let
him
into
the
ballroom
no
really
azazello
added
and
announced
midnight
is
approaching
messire
ah
very
good
woland
turned
to
margarita
and
so
if
you
please
i
thank
you
beforehand
don
t
become
flustered
and
don
t
be
afraid
of
anything
drink
nothing
but
water
otherwise
you
ll
get
groggy
and
it
will
be
hard
for
you
it
s
time
margarita
got
up
from
the
rug
and
then
koroviev
appeared
in
the
doorway
chapter
the
great
ball
at
satan
s
midnight
was
approaching
they
had
to
hurry
margarita
dimly
perceived
her
surroundings
candles
and
a
jewelled
pool
remained
in
her
memory
as
she
stood
in
the
bottom
of
this
pool
hella
with
the
assistance
of
natasha
doused
her
with
some
hot
thick
and
red
liquid
margarita
felt
a
salty
taste
on
her
lips
and
realized
that
she
was
being
washed
in
blood
the
bloody
mantle
was
changed
for
another
thick
transparent
pinkish
and
margarita
s
head
began
to
spin
from
rose
oil
then
margarita
was
laid
on
a
crystal
couch
and
rubbed
with
some
big
green
leaves
until
she
shone
here
the
cat
burst
in
and
started
to
help
he
squatted
down
at
margarita
s
feet
and
began
rubbing
up
her
soles
with
the
air
of
someone
shining
shoes
in
the
street
margarita
does
not
remember
who
stitched
slippers
for
her
from
pale
rose
petals
or
how
these
slippers
got
fastened
by
themselves
with
golden
clasps
some
force
snatched
margarita
up
and
put
her
before
a
mirror
and
a
royal
diamond
crown
gleamed
in
her
hair
koroviev
appeared
from
somewhere
and
hung
a
heavy
ovalframed
picture
of
a
black
poodle
by
a
heavy
chain
on
margarita
s
breast
this
adornment
was
extremely
burdensome
to
the
queen
the
chain
at
once
began
to
chafe
her
neck
the
picture
pulled
her
down
but
something
compensated
margarita
for
the
inconveniences
that
the
chain
with
the
black
poodle
caused
her
and
this
was
the
deference
with
which
koroviev
and
behemoth
began
to
treat
her
never
mind
never
mind
never
mind
muttered
koroviev
at
the
door
of
the
room
with
the
pool
no
help
for
it
you
must
must
must
allow
me
queen
to
give
you
a
last
piece
of
advice
among
the
guests
there
will
be
different
sorts
oh
very
different
but
no
one
queen
margot
should
beshown
any
preference
even
if
you
don
t
like
someone
i
understand
that
you
will
not
of
course
show
it
on
your
face
no
no
it
s
unthinkable
he
ll
notice
it
he
ll
notice
it
instantly
you
must
love
him
love
him
queen
the
mistress
of
the
ball
will
be
rewarded
a
hundredfold
for
that
and
also
don
t
ignore
anyone
at
least
a
little
smile
if
there
s
no
time
to
drop
a
word
at
least
a
tiny
turn
of
the
head
anything
you
like
but
not
inattention
they
ll
sicken
from
that
here
margarita
accompanied
by
koroviev
and
behemoth
stepped
out
of
the
room
with
the
pool
into
total
darkness
i
i
whispered
the
cat
i
give
the
signal
go
ahead
koroviev
replied
from
the
darkness
the
ball
shrieked
the
cat
piercingly
and
just
then
margarita
cried
out
and
shut
her
eyes
for
a
few
seconds
the
ball
fell
on
her
all
at
once
in
the
form
of
light
and
with
it
of
sound
and
smell
taken
under
the
arm
by
koroviev
margarita
saw
herself
in
a
tropical
forest
redbreasted
greentailed
parrots
fluttered
from
liana
to
liana
and
cried
out
deafeningly
delighted
but
the
forest
soon
ended
and
its
bathhouse
stuffiness
changed
at
once
to
the
coolness
of
a
ballroom
with
columns
of
some
yellowish
sparkling
stone
this
ballroom
just
like
the
forest
was
completely
empty
except
for
some
naked
negroes
with
silver
bands
on
their
heads
who
were
standing
by
the
columns
their
faces
turned
a
dirty
brown
from
excitement
when
margarita
flew
into
the
ballroom
with
her
retinue
in
which
azazello
showed
up
from
somewhere
here
koroviev
let
go
of
margarita
s
arm
and
whispered
straight
to
the
tulips
a
low
wall
of
white
tulips
had
grown
up
in
front
of
margarita
and
beyond
it
she
saw
numberless
lamps
under
little
shades
and
behind
them
the
white
chests
and
black
shoulders
of
tailcoaters
then
margarita
understood
where
the
sound
of
the
ball
was
coming
from
the
roar
of
trumpets
crashed
down
on
her
and
the
soaring
of
violins
that
burst
from
under
it
doused
her
body
as
if
with
blood
the
orchestra
of
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
men
was
playing
a
polonaise
the
tailcoated
man
hovering
over
the
orchestra
paled
on
seeing
margarita
smiled
and
suddenly
with
a
sweep
of
his
arms
got
the
whole
orchestra
to
its
feet
not
interrupting
the
music
for
a
moment
the
orchestra
standing
doused
margarita
with
sound
the
man
over
the
orchestra
turned
from
it
and
bowed
deeply
spreading
his
arms
wide
and
margarita
smiling
waved
her
hand
to
him
no
not
enough
not
enough
whispered
koroviev
he
won
t
sleep
all
night
call
out
to
him
greetings
to
you
waltz
king
margarita
cried
it
out
and
marvelled
that
her
voice
full
as
a
bell
was
heard
over
the
howling
of
the
orchestra
the
man
started
with
happiness
and
put
his
left
hand
to
his
chest
while
the
right
went
on
brandishing
a
white
baton
at
the
orchestra
not
enough
not
enough
whispered
koroviev
look
to
the
left
to
the
first
violins
and
nod
so
that
each
one
thinks
you
ve
recognized
him
individually
there
are
only
world
celebrities
here
nod
to
that
one
at
the
first
stand
that
s
vieuxtemps
there
very
good
now
onward
who
is
the
conductor
margarita
asked
flying
off
johann
strauss
cried
the
cat
and
they
can
hang
me
from
a
liana
in
a
tropical
forest
if
such
an
orchestra
ever
played
at
any
ball
i
invited
them
and
note
not
one
got
sick
or
declined
in
the
next
room
there
were
no
columns
instead
there
stood
walls
of
red
pink
and
milkwhite
roses
on
one
side
and
on
the
other
a
wall
of
japanese
double
camellias
between
these
walls
fountains
spurted
up
hissing
and
bubbly
champagne
seethed
in
three
pools
the
first
of
which
was
transparent
violet
the
second
ruby
the
third
crystal
next
to
them
negroes
in
scarlet
headbands
dashed
about
filling
flat
cups
from
the
pools
with
silver
dippers
the
pink
wall
had
a
gap
in
it
where
a
man
in
a
red
swallowtail
coat
was
flailing
away
on
a
platform
before
him
thundered
an
unbearably
loud
jazz
band
as
soon
as
the
conductor
saw
margarita
he
bent
before
her
so
that
his
hands
touched
the
floor
then
straightened
up
and
cried
piercingly
hallelujah
he
slapped
himself
on
the
knee
one
then
crisscross
on
the
other
knee
two
then
snatched
a
cymbal
from
the
hands
of
the
end
musician
and
banged
it
on
a
column
as
she
flew
off
margarita
saw
only
that
the
virtuoso
jazzman
fighting
against
the
polonaise
blowing
in
margarita
s
back
was
beating
his
jazzmen
on
the
heads
with
the
cymbal
while
they
cowered
in
comic
fright
finally
they
flew
out
on
to
the
landing
where
as
margarita
realized
she
had
been
met
in
the
dark
by
koroviev
with
his
little
lamp
now
on
this
landing
the
light
pouring
from
clusters
of
crystal
grapes
blinded
the
eye
margarita
was
put
in
place
and
under
her
left
arm
she
found
a
low
amethyst
column
you
may
rest
your
arm
on
it
if
it
becomes
too
difficult
koroviev
whispered
some
black
man
threw
a
pillow
under
margarita
s
feet
embroidered
with
a
golden
poodle
and
she
obedient
to
someone
s
hands
bent
her
right
leg
at
the
knee
and
placed
her
foot
on
it
margarita
tried
to
look
around
koroviev
and
azazello
stood
beside
her
in
formal
poses
next
to
azazello
stood
another
three
young
men
vaguely
reminding
margarita
of
abaddon
it
blew
cold
in
her
back
looking
there
margarita
saw
bubbly
wine
spurt
from
the
marble
wall
behind
her
and
pour
into
a
pool
of
ice
at
her
left
foot
she
felt
something
warm
and
furry
it
was
behemoth
margarita
was
high
up
and
a
grandiose
stairway
covered
with
carpet
descended
from
her
feet
below
so
far
away
that
it
was
as
if
margarita
were
looking
the
wrong
way
through
binoculars
she
saw
a
vast
front
hall
with
an
absolutely
enormous
fireplace
into
the
cold
and
black
maw
of
which
a
fiveton
truck
could
easily
have
driven
the
front
hall
and
stairway
so
flooded
with
light
that
it
hurt
the
eyes
were
empty
the
sound
of
trumpets
now
came
to
margarita
from
far
away
thus
they
stood
motionless
for
about
a
minute
but
where
are
the
guests
margarita
asked
koroviev
they
ll
come
queen
they
ll
come
they
ll
come
soon
enough
there
ll
be
no
lack
of
them
and
really
i
d
rather
go
and
chop
wood
than
receive
them
here
on
the
landing
chop
wood
hahl
picked
up
the
garrulous
cat
i
d
rather
work
as
a
tram
conductor
and
there
s
no
worse
job
in
the
world
than
that
everything
must
be
made
ready
in
advance
queen
explained
koroviev
his
eye
gleaming
through
the
broken
monocle
there
s
nothing
more
loathsome
than
when
the
first
guest
to
arrive
languishes
not
knowing
what
to
do
and
his
lawful
beldame
nags
at
him
in
a
whisper
for
having
come
before
everybody
else
such
balls
should
be
thrown
in
the
trash
queen
definitely
in
the
trash
confirmed
the
cat
no
more
than
ten
seconds
till
midnight
said
koroviev
it
ll
start
presently
those
ten
seconds
seemed
extremely
long
to
margarita
obviously
they
had
already
passed
and
precisely
nothing
had
happened
but
here
something
suddenly
crashed
downstairs
in
the
huge
fireplace
and
from
it
leaped
a
gallows
with
some
halfdecayed
remains
dangling
from
it
the
remains
fell
from
the
rope
struck
the
floor
and
from
it
leaped
a
handsome
darkhaired
man
in
a
tailcoat
and
patent
leather
shoes
a
halfrotten
little
coffin
ran
out
of
the
fireplace
its
lid
fell
off
and
another
remains
tumbled
out
of
it
the
handsome
man
gallantly
leaped
over
to
it
and
offered
it
his
bent
arm
the
second
remains
put
itself
together
into
a
fidgety
woman
in
black
shoes
with
black
feathers
on
her
head
and
then
the
man
and
the
woman
both
hastened
up
the
stairs
the
first
exclaimed
koroviev
monsieur
jacques
and
his
spouse
i
commend
to
you
queen
one
of
the
most
interesting
of
men
a
confirmed
counterfeiter
a
traitor
to
his
government
but
a
rather
good
alchemist
famous
koroviev
whispered
in
margarita
s
ear
for
having
poisoned
a
king
s
mistress
that
doesn
t
happen
to
everyone
look
how
handsome
he
is
the
pale
margarita
her
mouth
open
watched
as
both
gallows
and
coffin
disappeared
into
some
side
passage
in
the
front
hall
delighted
the
cat
yelled
right
into
the
face
of
monsieur
jacques
as
he
came
up
the
stairs
at
that
moment
a
headless
skeleton
with
a
tornoff
arm
emerged
from
the
fireplace
struck
the
ground
and
turned
into
a
man
in
a
tailcoat
monsieur
jacques
s
spouse
was
already
going
on
one
knee
before
margarita
and
pale
with
excitement
was
kissing
margarita
s
foot
queen
monsieur
jacques
s
spouse
murmured
the
queen
is
delighted
cried
koroviev
queen
the
handsome
monsieur
jacques
said
quietly
we
re
delighted
howled
the
cat
the
young
men
azazello
s
companions
smiling
lifeless
but
affable
smiles
were
already
shouldering
monsieur
jacques
and
his
spouse
to
one
side
towards
the
cups
of
champagne
that
the
negroes
were
holding
the
single
man
in
the
tailcoat
was
coming
up
the
stairs
at
a
run
earl
robert
koroviev
whispered
to
margarita
interesting
as
ever
note
how
funny
queen
the
reverse
case
this
one
was
a
queen
s
lover
and
poisoned
his
wife
we
re
very
glad
earl
cried
behemoth
out
of
the
fireplace
bursting
open
and
falling
apart
three
coffins
tumbled
one
after
another
then
came
someone
in
a
black
mantle
whom
the
next
one
to
run
out
of
the
black
maw
stabbed
in
the
back
with
a
knife
a
stifled
cry
was
heard
from
below
an
almost
entirely
decomposed
corpse
ran
out
of
the
fireplace
margarita
shut
her
eyes
and
someone
s
hand
held
a
flacon
of
smelling
salts
to
her
nose
margarita
thought
the
hand
was
natasha
s
the
stairway
began
to
fill
up
now
on
each
step
there
were
tailcoaters
looking
quite
alike
from
afar
and
naked
women
with
them
who
differed
from
each
other
only
in
the
colour
of
their
shoes
and
of
the
feathers
on
their
heads
coming
towards
margarita
hobbling
a
strange
wooden
boot
on
her
left
foot
was
a
lady
with
nunnishly
lowered
eyes
thin
and
modest
and
with
a
wide
green
band
around
her
neck
for
some
reason
who
is
this
green
one
margarita
asked
mechanically
a
most
charming
and
respectable
lady
whispered
koroviev
i
commend
her
to
you
madame
tofana
extremely
popular
among
young
lovely
neapolitans
as
well
as
the
ladies
of
palermo
especially
those
of
them
who
had
grown
weary
of
their
husbands
it
does
happen
queen
that
one
grows
weary
of
one
s
husband
yes
margarita
replied
in
a
hollow
voice
smiling
at
the
same
time
to
two
tailcoaters
who
bent
before
her
one
after
the
other
kissing
her
knee
and
hand
and
so
koroviev
managed
to
whisper
to
margarita
and
at
the
same
time
to
cry
out
to
someone
duke
a
glass
of
champagne
i
m
delighted
yes
so
then
madame
tofana
entered
into
the
situation
of
these
poor
women
and
sold
them
some
sort
of
water
in
little
vials
the
wife
poured
this
water
into
her
spouse
s
soup
he
ate
it
thanked
her
for
being
so
nice
and
felt
perfectly
well
true
a
few
hours
later
he
would
begin
to
get
very
thirsty
then
go
to
bed
and
a
day
later
the
lovely
neapolitan
who
had
fed
her
husband
soup
would
be
free
as
the
spring
breeze
but
what
s
that
on
her
foot
asked
margarita
tirelessly
offering
her
hand
to
the
guests
who
came
ahead
of
the
hobbling
madame
tofana
and
why
that
green
band
a
withered
neck
delighted
prince
cried
koroviev
and
at
the
same
time
whispered
to
margarita
a
beautiful
neck
but
an
unpleasantness
happened
to
her
in
prison
what
she
has
on
her
foot
queen
is
a
spanish
boot
and
the
band
is
explained
this
way
when
the
prison
guards
learned
that
some
five
hundred
illchosen
husbands
had
departed
naples
and
palermo
for
ever
in
the
heat
of
the
moment
they
strangled
madame
tofana
in
prison
how
happy
i
am
o
kindest
queen
that
the
high
honour
has
fallen
to
me
tofana
whispered
nunnishly
trying
to
lower
herself
to
one
knee
the
spanish
boot
hindered
her
koroviev
and
behemoth
helped
her
up
i
m
very
glad
margarita
answered
her
at
the
same
time
offering
her
hand
to
others
now
a
steady
stream
was
coming
up
the
stairs
from
below
margarita
could
no
longer
see
what
was
going
on
in
the
front
hall
she
mechanically
raised
and
lowered
her
hand
and
smiled
uniformly
to
the
guests
there
was
a
hum
in
the
air
on
the
landing
from
the
ballrooms
margarita
had
left
music
could
be
heard
like
the
sea
but
this
one
is
a
boring
woman
koroviev
no
longer
whispered
but
spoke
aloud
knowing
that
in
the
hubbub
of
voices
no
one
would
hear
him
she
adores
balls
and
keeps
dreaming
of
complaining
about
her
handkerchief
margarita
s
glance
picked
out
among
those
coming
up
the
woman
at
whom
koroviev
was
pointing
she
was
young
about
twenty
of
remarkably
beautiful
figure
but
with
somehow
restless
and
importunate
eyes
what
handkerchief
asked
margarita
she
has
a
chambermaid
assigned
to
her
explained
koroviev
who
for
thirty
years
has
been
putting
a
handkerchief
on
her
night
table
during
the
night
she
wakes
up
and
the
handkerchief
is
there
she
s
tried
burning
it
in
the
stove
and
drowning
it
in
the
river
but
nothing
helps
what
handkerchief
whispered
margarita
raising
and
lowering
her
arm
a
bluebordered
one
the
thing
is
that
when
she
worked
in
a
café
the
owner
once
invited
her
to
the
pantry
and
nine
months
later
she
gave
birth
to
a
boy
took
him
to
the
forest
stuffed
the
handkerchief
into
his
mouth
and
then
buried
the
boy
in
the
ground
at
the
trial
she
said
she
had
no
wayof
feeding
the
child
and
where
is
the
owner
of
the
café
asked
margarita
queen
the
cat
suddenly
creaked
from
below
what
may
i
ask
does
the
owner
have
to
do
with
it
it
wasn
t
he
who
smothered
the
infant
in
the
forest
margarita
without
ceasing
to
smile
and
proffer
her
right
hand
dug
the
sharp
nails
of
the
left
into
behemoth
s
ear
and
whispered
to
him
if
you
scum
allow
yourself
to
interfere
in
the
conversation
again
behemoth
squeaked
in
a
not
very
balllike
fashion
and
rasped
queen
the
ear
will
get
swollen
why
spoil
the
ball
with
a
swollen
ear
i
was
speaking
legally
from
the
legal
point
of
view
i
say
no
more
i
say
no
more
consider
me
not
a
cat
but
a
post
only
let
go
of
my
ear
margarita
released
his
ear
and
the
importunate
gloomy
eyes
were
before
her
i
am
happy
queenhostess
to
be
invited
to
the
great
ball
of
the
full
moon
and
i
am
glad
to
see
you
margarita
answered
her
very
glad
do
you
like
champagne
what
are
you
doing
queen
koroviev
cried
desperately
but
soundlessly
in
margarita
s
ear
there
ll
be
a
traffic
jam
yes
i
do
the
woman
said
imploringly
and
suddenly
began
repeating
mechanically
frieda
frieda
frieda
my
name
is
frieda
queen
get
drunk
tonight
frieda
and
don
t
think
about
anything
said
margarita
frieda
reached
out
both
arms
to
margarita
but
koroviev
and
behemoth
very
adroitly
took
her
under
the
arms
and
she
blended
into
the
crowd
now
people
were
coming
in
a
solid
wall
from
below
as
if
storming
the
landing
where
margarita
stood
naked
women
s
bodies
came
up
between
tailcoated
men
their
swarthy
white
coffeebeancoloured
and
altogether
black
bodies
floated
towards
margarita
in
their
hair
red
black
chestnut
light
as
flax
precious
stones
glittered
and
danced
spraying
sparkles
into
the
flood
of
light
and
as
if
someone
hadsprinkled
the
storming
column
of
men
with
droplets
of
light
diamond
studs
sprayed
light
from
their
chests
every
second
now
margarita
felt
lips
touch
her
knee
every
second
she
held
out
her
hand
to
be
kissed
her
face
was
contracted
into
a
fixed
mask
of
greeting
i
m
delighted
koroviev
sang
monotonously
we
re
delighted
the
queen
is
delighted
the
queen

delighted
azazello
echoed
nasally
behind
her
back
i
m
delighted
the
cat
kept
exclaiming
the
marquise
muttered
koroviev
poisoned
her
father
two
brothers
and
two
sisters
for
the
inheritance
the
queen
is

madame

wonderful
brothel
she
ran
in
strasbourg
we
re
delighted
a
moscow
dressmaker
we
all
love
her
for
her
inexhaustible
fantasy
she
kept
a
shop
and
invented
a
terribly
funny
trick
drilled
two
round
holes
in
the
wall
and
the
ladies
didn
t
know
asked
margarita
every
one
of
them
knew
queen
answered
koroviev
delighted
this
twentyyearold
boy
was
distinguished
from
childhood
by
strange
qualities
a
dreamer
and
an
eccentric
a
girl
fell
in
love
with
him
and
he
went
and
sold
her
to
a
brothel
a
river
came
streaming
from
below
and
there
was
no
end
to
this
river
in
sight
its
source
the
enormous
fireplace
continued
to
feed
it
thus
one
hour
passed
and
a
second
commenced
here
margarita
began
to
notice
that
her
chain
had
become
heavier
than
before
something
strange
also
happened
with
her
arm
now
before
raising
it
margarita
had
to
wince
koroviev
s
interesting
observations
ceased
to
amuse
margarita
slanteyed
mongolian
faces
white
faces
and
black
became
undifferentiated
to
her
they
merged
at
times
and
the
air
between
them
would
for
some
reason
begin
to
tremble
and
flow
a
sharp
pain
as
if
from
a
needle
suddenly
pierced
margarita
s
right
arm
and
clenching
her
teeth
she
rested
her
elbow
on
the
post
some
rustling
as
if
from
wings
against
the
walls
was
now
coming
from
the
ballroom
and
it
was
clear
that
unprecedented
hordes
of
guests
were
dancing
there
and
it
seemed
to
margarita
that
even
the
massive
marble
mosaic
and
crystal
floors
of
this
prodigious
room
were
pulsing
rhythmically
neither
gaius
caesar
caligula
nor
messalina
interested
margarita
any
longer
nor
did
any
of
the
kings
dukes
cavaliers
suicides
poisoners
gallowsbirds
procuresses
prison
guards
and
sharpers
executioners
informers
traitors
madmen
sleuths
seducers
all
their
names
became
jumbled
in
her
head
the
faces
stuck
together
into
one
huge
pancake
and
only
a
single
face
lodged
itself
painfully
in
her
memory
the
face
framed
in
a
truly
fiery
beard
of
maliuta
skuratov
margarita
s
legs
kept
giving
way
she
was
afraid
of
bursting
into
tears
at
any
moment
the
worst
suffering
was
caused
by
her
right
knee
which
was
being
kissed
it
became
swollen
the
skin
turned
blue
even
though
natasha
s
hand
appeared
by
this
knee
several
times
with
a
sponge
wiping
it
with
somethingfragrant
at
the
end
of
the
third
hour
margarita
glanced
down
with
completely
desperate
eyes
and
gave
a
joyful
start
the
stream
of
guests
was
thinning
out
balls
always
assemble
according
to
the
same
laws
queen
whispered
koroviev
presently
the
wave
will
begin
to
subside
i
swear
we
re
enduring
the
final
minutes
here
s
the
group
of
revellers
from
brocken
they
always
come
last
yes
here
they
are
two
drunken
vampires
that
s
allah
no
here
s
one
more
no
two
the
last
two
guests
were
coming
up
the
stairs
it
s
some
new
one
koroviev
was
saying
squinting
through
his
lens
ah
yes
yes
azazello
visited
him
once
and
over
the
cognac
whispered
some
advice
to
him
on
how
to
get
rid
of
a
certain
man
whose
exposures
he
was
extremely
afraid
of
and
so
he
told
an
acquaintance
who
was
dependent
on
him
to
spray
the
walls
of
the
office
with
poison
what
s
his
name
asked
margarita
ah
really
i
myself
don
t
know
yet
koroviev
replied
well
have
to
ask
azazello
and
who
is
with
him
why
that
same
efficient
subordinate
of
his
delighted
cried
koroviev
to
the
last
two
the
stairway
was
empty
they
waited
a
little
longer
as
a
precaution
but
no
one
else
came
from
the
fireplace
a
second
later
without
knowing
how
it
happened
margarita
found
herself
in
the
same
room
with
the
pool
and
there
bursting
into
tears
at
once
from
the
pain
in
her
arm
and
leg
she
collapsed
right
on
the
floor
but
hella
and
natasha
comforting
her
again
drew
her
under
the
bloody
shower
again
massaged
her
body
and
margarita
revived
there
s
more
there
s
more
queen
margot
whispered
koroviev
appearing
beside
her
you
must
fly
around
the
rooms
so
that
the
honourable
guests
don
t
feel
they
ve
been
abandoned
and
once
more
margarita
flew
out
of
the
room
with
the
pool
on
the
stage
behind
the
tulips
where
the
waltz
king
s
orchestra
had
been
playing
there
now
raged
an
ape
jazz
band
a
huge
gorilla
with
shaggy
sidewhiskers
a
trumpet
in
his
hand
capering
heavily
was
doing
the
conducting
orangutans
sat
in
a
row
blowing
on
shiny
trumpets
perched
on
their
shoulders
were
merry
chimpanzees
with
concertinas
twohamadryads
with
manes
like
lions
played
grand
pianos
but
these
grand
pianos
were
not
heard
amidst
the
thundering
squeaking
and
booming
of
saxophones
fiddles
and
drums
in
the
paws
of
gibbons
mandrills
and
marmosets
on
the
mirror
floor
a
countless
number
of
couples
as
if
merged
amazing
in
the
deftness
and
cleanness
of
their
movements
all
turning
in
the
same
direction
swept
on
like
a
wall
threatening
to
clear
away
everything
in
its
path
live
satin
butterflies
bobbed
above
the
heads
of
the
dancing
hordes
flowers
poured
down
from
the
ceiling
in
the
capitals
of
the
columns
each
time
the
electricity
went
off
myriads
of
fireflies
lit
up
and
marshlights
floated
in
the
air
then
margarita
found
herself
in
a
room
with
a
pool
of
monstrous
size
bordered
by
a
colonnade
a
giant
black
neptune
spouted
a
wide
pink
stream
from
his
maw
a
stupefying
smell
of
champagne
rose
from
the
pool
here
unconstrained
merriment
held
sway
ladies
laughing
gave
their
handbags
to
their
cavaliers
or
the
negroes
who
rushed
about
with
towels
in
their
hands
and
with
a
cry
dived
swallowlike
into
the
pool
foamy
columns
shot
up
the
crystal
bottom
of
the
pool
shone
with
light
from
below
that
broke
through
the
density
of
the
wine
and
in
it
the
silvery
swimming
bodies
could
be
seen
the
ladies
got
out
of
the
pool
completely
drunk
loud
laughter
resounded
under
the
columns
booming
like
the
jazz
band
all
that
was
remembered
from
this
turmoil
was
the
completely
drunken
face
of
a
woman
with
senseless
and
even
in
their
senselessness
imploring
eyes
and
only
one
name
frieda
was
recalled
margarita
s
head
began
to
spin
from
the
smell
of
the
wine
and
she
was
about
to
leave
when
the
cat
arranged
a
number
in
the
pool
that
detained
her
behemoth
performed
some
magic
by
neptune
s
maw
and
at
once
the
billowing
mass
of
champagne
hissing
and
gurgling
left
the
pool
and
neptune
began
spewing
out
a
stream
neither
glittering
nor
foaming
but
of
a
darkyellow
colour
the
ladies
shrieking
and
screaming
cognac
rushed
from
the
poolside
and
hid
behind
the
columns
in
a
few
seconds
the
pool
was
filled
and
the
cat
turning
three
times
in
the
air
dropped
into
the
heaving
cognac
he
crawled
out
spluttering
his
bowtie
limp
the
gilding
on
his
whiskers
gone
along
with
the
opera
glasses
only
one
woman
dared
to
follow
behemoth
s
example
that
same
frolicsome
dressmaker
with
her
cavalier
an
unknown
young
mulatto
the
two
threw
themselves
into
the
cognac
but
here
koroviev
took
margarita
under
the
arm
and
they
left
the
bathers
it
seemed
to
margarita
that
she
flew
somewhere
where
she
saw
mountains
of
oysters
in
huge
stone
basins
then
she
flew
over
a
glass
floor
with
infernal
furnaces
burning
under
it
and
devilish
white
cooks
darting
among
them
then
somewhere
already
ceasing
to
comprehend
anything
she
saw
dark
cellars
where
some
sort
of
lamps
burned
where
girls
served
meat
sizzling
on
redhot
coals
where
her
health
was
drunk
from
big
mugs
then
she
saw
polar
bears
playing
concertinas
and
dancing
the
kamarinsky
on
a
platform
a
salamanderconjurer
who
did
not
burn
in
the
fireplace
and
for
the
second
time
her
strength
began
to
ebb
one
last
appearance
koroviev
whispered
to
her
anxiously
and
then
we
re
free
accompanied
by
koroviev
she
again
found
herself
in
the
ballroom
but
now
there
was
no
dancing
in
it
and
the
guests
in
a
numberless
throng
pressed
back
between
the
columns
leaving
the
middle
of
the
room
open
margarita
did
not
remember
who
helped
her
to
get
up
on
the
dais
that
appeared
in
the
middle
of
this
open
space
in
the
room
when
she
was
up
on
it
to
her
own
amazement
she
heard
a
clock
strike
midnight
somewhere
though
by
her
reckoning
it
was
long
past
at
the
last
stroke
of
the
clock
which
came
from
no
one
knew
where
silence
fell
on
the
crowd
of
guests
then
margarita
saw
woland
again
he
walked
in
surrounded
by
abaddon
azazello
and
several
others
who
resembled
abaddon
darkhaired
and
young
now
margarita
saw
that
opposite
her
dais
another
had
been
prepared
for
woland
but
he
did
not
make
use
of
it
what
struck
margarita
was
that
woland
came
out
for
this
last
great
appearance
at
the
ball
looking
just
the
same
as
he
had
looked
in
the
bedroom
the
same
dirty
patched
shirt
hung
on
his
shoulders
his
feet
were
in
wornout
bedroom
slippers
woland
had
a
sword
but
he
used
this
bare
sword
as
a
cane
leaning
on
it
limping
woland
stopped
at
his
dais
and
immediately
azazello
was
before
him
with
a
platter
in
his
hands
and
on
this
platter
margarita
saw
a
man
s
severed
head
with
the
front
teeth
knocked
out
total
silence
continued
to
reign
broken
only
once
by
the
faroff
sound
inexplicable
under
the
circumstances
of
a
doorbell
coming
as
if
from
the
front
hall
mikhail
alexandrovich
woland
addressed
the
head
in
a
low
voice
and
then
the
slain
man
s
eyelids
rose
and
on
the
dead
face
margarita
saw
with
a
shudder
living
eyes
filled
with
thought
and
suffering
everything
came
to
pass
did
it
not
woland
went
on
looking
into
the
head
s
eyes
the
head
was
cut
off
by
a
woman
the
meeting
did
not
take
place
and
i
am
living
in
your
apartment
that
is
a
fact
and
fact
is
the
most
stubborn
thing
in
the
world
but
we
are
now
interested
in
what
follows
and
not
in
this
already
accomplished
fact
you
have
always
been
an
ardent
preacher
of
the
theory
that
on
the
cutting
off
of
his
head
life
ceases
in
a
man
he
turns
to
ashes
and
goes
into
nonbeing
i
have
the
pleasure
of
informing
you
in
the
presence
of
my
guests
though
they
serve
as
proof
of
quite
a
different
theory
that
your
theory
is
both
solid
and
clever
however
one
theory
is
as
good
as
another
there
is
also
one
which
holds
that
it
will
be
given
to
each
according
to
his
faith
let
it
come
true
you
go
into
nonbeing
and
from
the
cup
into
which
you
are
to
be
transformed
i
will
joyfully
drink
to
being
woland
raised
his
sword
straight
away
the
flesh
of
the
head
turned
dark
and
shrivelled
then
fell
off
in
pieces
the
eyes
disappeared
and
soon
margarita
saw
on
the
platter
a
yellowish
skull
with
emerald
eyes
pearl
teeth
and
a
golden
foot
the
lid
opened
on
a
hinge
right
this
second
messire
said
koroviev
noticing
woland
s
questioning
look
hell
appear
before
you
in
this
sepulchral
silence
i
can
hear
the
creaking
of
his
patent
leather
shoes
and
the
clink
of
the
goblet
he
has
just
set
down
on
the
table
having
drunk
champagne
for
the
last
time
inhis
life
here
he
is
a
solitary
new
guest
was
entering
the
room
heading
towards
woland
outwardly
he
did
not
differ
in
any
way
from
the
numerous
other
male
guests
except
for
one
thing
this
guest
was
literally
reeling
with
agitation
which
could
be
seen
even
from
afar
flushed
spots
burned
on
his
cheeks
and
his
eyes
darted
about
in
total
alarm
the
guest
was
dumbstruck
and
that
was
perfectly
natural
he
was
astounded
by
everything
and
above
all
of
course
by
woland
s
attire
however
the
guest
was
met
with
the
utmost
kindness
ah
my
dearest
baron
meigel
woland
smiling
affably
addressed
the
guest
whose
eyes
were
popping
out
of
his
head
i
m
happy
to
commend
to
you
woland
turned
to
the
other
guests
the
most
esteemed
baron
meigel
an
employee
of
the
spectacles
commission
in
charge
of
acquainting
foreigners
with
places
of
interest
in
the
capital
here
margarita
froze
because
she
recognized
this
meigel
she
had
come
across
him
several
times
in
moscow
theatres
and
restaurants
excuse
me
thought
margarita
but
that
means
what
that
he
s
also
dead
but
the
matter
straight
away
clarified
itself
the
dear
baron
woland
went
on
smiling
joyfully
was
so
charming
that
having
learned
of
my
arrival
in
moscow
he
rang
me
up
at
once
offering
his
services
along
the
line
of
his
expertise
that
is
acquainting
people
with
places
of
interest
it
goes
without
saying
that
i
was
happy
to
invite
him
here
just
then
margarita
saw
azazello
hand
the
platter
with
the
skull
to
koroviev
ah
yes
incidentally
baron
woland
said
suddenly
lowering
his
voice
intimately
rumours
have
spread
about
your
extreme
curiosity
they
say
that
combined
with
your
no
less
developed
talkativeness
it
was
beginning
to
attract
general
attention
what
s
more
wicked
tongues
have
already
dropped
the
word
a
stoolpigeon
and
a
spy
and
what
s
still
more
it
is
hinted
that
this
will
bring
you
to
a
sorry
end
in
no
more
than
a
month
and
so
in
order
to
deliver
you
from
this
painful
anticipation
we
have
decided
to
come
to
your
aid
taking
advantage
of
the
fact
that
you
invited
yourself
here
precisely
with
the
purpose
of
eavesdropping
and
spying
out
whatever
you
can
the
baron
turned
paler
than
abaddon
who
was
exceptionally
pale
by
nature
and
then
something
strange
took
place
abaddon
stood
in
front
of
the
baron
and
took
off
his
glasses
for
a
second
at
the
same
moment
something
flashed
fire
in
azazello
s
hand
something
clapped
softly
the
baron
began
to
fall
backwards
crimson
blood
spurted
from
his
chest
and
poured
down
his
starched
shirt
and
waistcoat
koroviev
put
the
cup
to
the
spurt
and
handed
the
full
cup
to
woland
the
baron
s
lifeless
body
was
by
that
time
already
on
the
floor
i
drink
your
health
ladies
and
gentlemen
woland
said
quietly
and
raising
the
cup
touched
it
to
his
lips
then
a
metamorphosis
occurred
the
patched
shirt
and
worn
slippers
disappeared
woland
was
in
some
sort
of
black
chlamys
with
a
steel
sword
on
his
hip
he
quickly
approached
margarita
offered
her
the
cup
and
said
imperiously
drink
margarita
became
dizzy
she
swayed
but
the
cup
was
already
at
her
lips
and
voices
she
could
not
make
out
whose
whispered
in
both
her
ears
don
t
be
afraid
queen
don
t
be
afraid
queen
the
blood
has
long
since
gone
into
the
earth
and
where
it
was
spilled
grapevines
are
already
growing
margarita
without
opening
her
eyes
took
a
gulp
and
a
sweet
current
ran
through
her
veins
a
ringing
began
in
her
ears
it
seemed
to
her
that
cocks
were
crowing
deafeningly
that
somewhere
a
march
was
being
played
the
crowds
of
guests
began
to
lose
their
shape
tailcoaters
and
women
fell
to
dust
decay
enveloped
the
room
before
margarita
s
eyes
a
sepulchral
smell
flowed
over
it
the
columns
fell
apart
the
fires
went
out
everything
shrank
there
were
no
more
fountains
no
camellias
no
tulips
and
there
was
simply
this
the
modest
living
room
of
the
jeweller
s
widow
and
a
strip
of
light
falling
from
a
slightly
opened
door
and
margarita
went
through
this
slightly
opened
door
chapter
the
extraction
of
the
master
in
woland
s
bedroom
everything
turned
out
to
be
as
it
had
been
before
the
ball
woland
was
sitting
on
the
bed
in
his
nightshirt
only
hella
was
no
longer
rubbing
his
leg
but
was
setting
out
supper
on
the
table
on
which
they
had
been
playing
chess
koroviev
and
azazello
having
removed
their
tailcoats
were
sitting
at
the
table
and
next
to
them
of
course
was
the
cat
who
refused
to
part
with
his
bowtie
though
it
had
turned
into
an
utterly
filthy
rag
margarita
swaying
came
up
to
the
table
and
leaned
on
it
then
woland
beckoned
her
to
him
like
the
other
time
and
indicated
that
she
should
sit
down
beside
him
well
did
they
wear
you
out
very
much
asked
woland
oh
no
messire
margarita
answered
but
barely
audibly
nobless
obleege
the
cat
observed
and
poured
some
transparent
liquid
into
a
goblet
for
margarita
is
that
vodka
margarita
asked
weakly
the
cat
jumped
up
on
his
chair
in
resentment
good
heavens
queen
he
croaked
would
i
allow
myself
to
pour
vodka
for
a
lady
it
s
pure
alcohol
margarita
smiled
and
made
an
attempt
to
push
the
glass
away
drink
boldly
said
woland
and
margarita
took
the
glass
in
her
hand
at
once
hella
sit
down
woland
ordered
and
explained
to
margarita
the
night
of
the
full
moon
is
a
festive
night
and
i
have
supper
in
the
small
company
of
my
retinue
and
servants
and
so
how
do
you
feel
how
did
this
tiring
ball
go
stupendous
rattled
koroviev
everybody
s
enchanted
infatuated
crushed
so
much
tact
so
much
skill
charm
and
loveliness
woland
silently
raised
his
glass
and
clinked
with
margarita
margarita
drank
obediently
thinking
that
this
alcohol
would
be
the
end
of
her
but
nothing
bad
happened
a
living
warmth
flowed
into
her
stomach
something
struck
her
softly
on
the
nape
her
strength
came
back
as
if
she
had
got
up
after
a
long
refreshing
sleep
with
a
wolfish
appetite
besides
and
on
recalling
that
she
had
eaten
nothing
since
the
previous
morning
it
flared
up
still
more
she
greedily
began
gulping
down
caviar
behemoth
cut
a
slice
of
pineapple
salted
it
peppered
it
ate
it
and
then
tossed
off
a
second
glass
of
alcohol
so
dashingly
that
everyone
applauded
after
margarita
s
second
glass
the
candles
in
the
candelabra
flared
up
more
brightly
and
the
flame
increased
in
the
fireplace
margarita
did
not
feel
drunk
at
all
biting
the
meat
with
her
white
teeth
margarita
savoured
the
juice
that
ran
from
it
at
the
same
time
watching
behemoth
spread
mustard
on
an
oyster
why
don
t
you
put
some
grapes
on
top
hella
said
quietly
nudging
the
cat
in
the
ribs
i
beg
you
not
to
teach
me
replied
behemoth
i
have
sat
at
table
don
t
worry
that
i
have
ah
how
nice
it
is
to
have
supper
like
this
by
the
fireside
simply
koroviev
clattered
in
a
small
circle
no
fagott
objected
the
cat
a
ball
has
its
own
charm
and
scope
there
s
no
charm
in
it
or
scope
either
and
those
idiotic
bears
and
tigers
in
the
bar
almost
gave
me
migraine
with
their
roaring
said
woland
i
obey
messire
said
the
cat
if
you
find
no
scope
i
will
immediately
begin
to
hold
the
same
opinion
watch
yourself
woland
said
to
that
i
was
joking
the
cat
said
humbly
and
as
far
as
the
tigers
are
concerned
i
ll
order
them
roasted
one
can
t
eat
tiger
said
hella
you
think
not
then
i
beg
you
to
listen
responded
the
cat
and
narrowing
his
eyes
with
pleasure
he
told
how
he
had
once
wandered
in
the
wilderness
for
nineteen
days
and
the
only
thing
he
had
to
eat
was
the
meat
of
a
tiger
he
had
killed
they
all
listened
to
this
entertaining
narrative
with
interest
and
when
behemoth
finished
exclaimed
in
chorus
bunk
and
the
most
interesting
thing
about
this
bunk
said
woland
is
that
it
s
bunk
from
first
word
to
last
ah
bunk
is
it
exclaimed
the
cat
and
they
all
thought
he
would
start
protesting
but
he
only
said
quietly
history
will
judge
and
tell
me
margot
revived
after
the
vodka
addressed
azazello
did
you
shoot
him
this
former
baron
naturally
answered
azazello
how
could
i
not
shoot
him
he
absolutely
had
to
be
shot
i
got
so
excited
exclaimed
margarita
it
happened
so
unexpectedly
there
was
nothing
unexpected
in
it
azazello
objected
but
koroviev
started
wailing
and
whining
how
not
get
excited
i
myself
was
quaking
in
my
boots
bang
hup
baron
on
his
back
i
nearly
had
hysterics
the
cat
added
licking
the
caviar
spoon
here
s
what
i
don
t
understand
margarita
said
and
golden
sparks
from
the
crystal
glittered
in
her
eyes
can
it
be
that
the
music
and
the
noise
of
this
ball
generally
weren
t
heard
outside
of
course
they
weren
t
queen
explained
koroviev
it
has
to
be
done
so
that
nothing
is
heard
it
has
to
be
done
carefully
well
yes
yes
but
the
thing
is
that
that
man
on
the
stairs
when
azazello
and
i
passed
by
and
the
other
one
by
the
entrance
i
think
he
was
watching
your
apartment
right
right
cried
koroviev
right
dear
margarita
nikolaevna
you
confirm
my
suspicions
yes
he
was
watching
the
apartment
i
myself
first
took
him
for
an
absentminded
assistant
professor
or
a
lover
languishing
on
the
stairs
but
no
no
something
kept
gnawing
at
my
heart
ah
he
was
watching
the
apartment
and
the
other
one
by
the
entrance
too
and
the
same
for
the
one
in
the
gateway
but
it
s
interesting
what
if
they
come
to
arrest
you
margarita
asked
they
re
sure
to
come
charming
queen
they
re
sure
to
replied
koroviev
my
heart
tells
me
they
ll
come
not
now
of
course
but
in
due
time
they
ll
certainly
come
but
i
don
t
suppose
it
will
be
very
interesting
ah
i
got
so
excited
when
that
baron
fell
said
margarita
evidently
still
reliving
the
murder
which
was
the
first
she
had
seen
in
her
life
you
must
be
a
very
good
shot
passable
replied
azazello
from
how
many
paces
margarita
asked
azazello
a
not
entirely
clear
question
depends
on
what
azazello
replied
reasonably
it
s
one
thing
to
hit
the
critic
latunsky
s
window
with
a
hammer
and
quite
another
thing
to
hit
him
in
the
heart
in
the
heart
exclaimed
margarita
for
some
reason
putting
her
hand
to
her
own
heart
in
the
heart
she
repeated
in
a
hollow
voice
who
is
this
critic
latunsky
asked
woland
narrowing
his
eyes
at
margarita
azazello
koroviev
and
behemoth
dropped
their
eyes
somehow
abashedly
and
margarita
answered
blushing
there
is
this
certain
critic
i
destroyed
his
whole
apartment
tonight
just
look
at
you
but
what
for
you
see
messire
margarita
explained
he
ruined
a
certain
master
but
why
go
to
such
trouble
yourself
asked
woland
allow
me
messire
the
cat
cried
out
joyfully
jumping
up
you
sit
down
azazello
grunted
standing
up
i
ll
go
myself
right
now
no
exclaimed
margarita
no
i
beg
you
messire
there
s
no
need
for
that
as
you
wish
as
you
wish
woland
replied
and
azazello
sat
down
in
his
place
so
where
were
we
precious
queen
margot
said
koroviev
ah
yes
the
heart
he
does
hit
the
heart
koroviev
pointed
his
long
finger
in
azazello
s
direction
as
you
choose
any
auricle
of
the
heart
or
any
ventricle
margarita
did
not
understand
at
first
and
when
she
did
she
exclaimed
in
surprise
but
they
re
covered
up
my
dear
clattered
koroviev
that
s
the
point
that
they
re
covered
up
that
s
the
whole
salt
of
it
anyone
can
hit
an
uncovered
object
koroviev
took
a
seven
of
spades
from
the
desk
drawer
offered
it
to
margarita
and
asked
her
to
mark
one
of
the
pips
with
her
fingernail
margarita
marked
the
one
in
the
upper
righthand
comer
hella
hid
the
card
under
a
pillow
crying
ready
azazello
who
was
sitting
with
his
back
to
the
pillow
drew
a
black
automatic
from
the
pocket
of
his
tailcoat
trousers
put
the
muzzle
over
his
shoulder
and
without
turning
towards
the
bed
fired
provoking
a
merry
fright
in
margarita
the
seven
was
taken
from
under
the
bulletpierced
pillow
the
pip
marked
by
margarita
had
a
hole
in
it
i
wouldn
t
want
to
meet
you
when
you
re
carrying
a
gun
margarita
said
casting
coquettish
glances
at
azazello
she
had
a
passion
for
anyone
who
did
something
topnotch
precious
queen
squeaked
koroviev
i
wouldn
t
advise
anyone
to
meet
him
even
if
he
s
not
carrying
a
gun
i
give
you
my
word
of
honour
as
an
exchoirmaster
and
precentor
that
no
one
would
congratulate
the
one
doing
the
meeting
the
cat
sat
scowling
throughout
the
shooting
trial
and
suddenly
announced
i
undertake
to
beat
the
record
with
the
seven
azazello
growled
out
something
in
reply
to
that
but
the
cat
was
stubborn
and
demanded
not
one
but
two
guns
azazello
took
a
second
gun
from
the
second
back
pocket
of
his
trousers
and
twisting
his
mouth
disdainfully
handed
it
to
the
braggart
together
with
the
first
two
pips
were
marked
on
the
seven
the
cat
made
lengthy
preparations
turning
his
back
to
the
pillow
margarita
sat
with
her
fingers
in
her
ears
and
looked
at
the
owl
dozing
on
the
mantelpiece
the
cat
fired
both
guns
after
which
hella
shrieked
at
once
the
owl
fell
dead
from
the
mantelpiece
and
the
smashed
clock
stopped
hella
whose
hand
was
all
bloody
clutched
at
the
cat
s
fur
with
a
howl
and
he
clutched
her
hair
in
retaliation
and
the
two
got
tangled
into
a
ball
and
rolled
on
the
floor
one
of
the
goblets
fell
from
the
table
and
broke
pull
this
rabid
hellion
off
me
wailed
the
cat
fighting
off
hella
who
was
sitting
astride
him
the
combatants
were
separated
and
koroviev
blew
on
hella
s
bulletpierced
finger
and
it
mended
i
can
t
shoot
when
someone
s
talking
at
my
elbow
shouted
behemoth
trying
to
stick
in
place
a
huge
clump
of
fur
pulled
from
his
back
i
ll
bet
said
woland
smiling
to
margarita
that
he
did
this
stunt
on
purpose
he
s
not
a
bad
shot
hella
and
the
cat
made
peace
and
as
a
sign
of
their
reconciliation
exchanged
kisses
the
card
was
taken
from
under
the
pillow
and
checked
not
a
single
pip
had
been
hit
except
for
the
one
shot
through
by
azazello
that
can
t
be
insisted
the
cat
holding
the
card
up
to
the
light
of
the
candelabra
the
merry
supper
went
on
the
candles
guttered
in
the
candelabra
the
dry
fragrant
warmth
of
the
fireplace
spread
waves
over
the
room
after
eating
margarita
was
enveloped
in
a
feeling
of
bliss
she
watched
the
bluegrey
smokerings
from
azazello
s
cigar
float
into
the
fireplace
while
the
cat
caught
them
on
the
tip
of
a
sword
she
did
not
want
to
go
anywhere
though
according
to
her
reckoning
it
was
already
late
by
all
tokens
it
was
getting
on
towards
six
in
the
morning
taking
advantage
of
a
pause
margarita
turned
to
woland
and
saidtimidly
i
suppose
it
s
time
for
me
it
s
late
what
s
your
hurry
asked
woland
politely
but
a
bit
drily
the
rest
kept
silent
pretending
to
be
occupied
with
the
smokerings
yes
it
s
time
margarita
repeated
quite
embarrassed
by
it
and
looked
around
as
if
searching
for
some
cape
or
cloak
she
was
suddenly
embarrassed
by
her
nakedness
she
got
up
from
the
table
woland
silently
took
his
wornout
and
greasy
dressinggown
from
the
bed
and
koroviev
threw
it
over
margarita
s
shoulders
i
thank
you
messire
margarita
said
barely
audibly
and
looked
questioningly
at
woland
in
reply
he
smiled
at
her
courteously
and
indifferently
black
anguish
somehow
surged
up
all
at
once
in
margarita
s
heart
she
felt
herself
deceived
no
rewards
would
be
offered
her
for
all
her
services
at
the
ball
apparently
just
as
no
one
was
detaining
her
and
yet
it
was
perfectly
clear
to
her
that
she
had
nowhere
to
go
the
fleeting
thought
of
having
to
return
to
her
house
provoked
an
inward
burst
of
despair
in
her
should
she
ask
as
azazello
had
temptingly
advised
in
the
alexandrovsky
garden
no
not
for
anything
she
said
to
herself
goodbye
messire
she
said
aloud
and
thought
i
must
just
get
out
of
here
and
then
i
ll
go
to
the
river
and
drown
myself
sit
down
now
woland
suddenly
said
imperiously
margarita
changed
countenance
and
sat
down
perhaps
you
want
to
say
something
before
you
leave
no
nothing
messire
margarita
answered
proudly
except
that
if
you
still
need
me
i
m
willing
and
ready
to
do
anything
you
wish
i
m
not
tired
in
the
least
and
i
had
a
very
good
time
at
the
ball
so
that
if
it
were
still
going
on
i
would
again
offer
my
knee
for
thousands
of
gallowsbirds
and
murderers
to
kiss
margarita
looked
at
woland
as
if
through
a
veil
her
eyes
filling
with
tears
true
you
re
perfectly
right
woland
cried
resoundingly
and
terribly
that
s
the
way
that
s
the
way
woland
s
retinue
repeated
like
an
echo
we
ve
been
testing
you
said
woland
never
ask
for
anything
never
for
anything
and
especially
from
those
who
are
stronger
than
you
they
ll
make
the
offer
themselves
and
give
everything
themselves
sit
down
proud
woman
woland
tore
the
heavy
dressinggown
from
margarita
and
again
she
found
herself
sitting
next
to
him
on
the
bed
and
so
margot
woland
went
on
softening
his
voice
what
do
you
want
for
having
been
my
hostess
tonight
what
do
you
wish
for
having
spent
the
ball
naked
what
price
do
you
put
on
your
knee
what
are
your
losses
from
my
guests
whom
you
just
called
gallowsbirds
speak
and
speak
now
without
constraint
for
it
is
i
who
offer
margarita
s
heart
began
to
pound
she
sighed
heavily
started
pondering
something
well
come
be
braver
woland
encouraged
her
rouse
your
fantasy
spur
it
on
merely
being
present
at
the
scene
of
the
murder
of
that
inveterate
blackguard
of
a
baron
is
worth
a
reward
particularly
if
the
person
is
a
woman
well
then
margarita
s
breath
was
taken
away
and
she
was
about
to
utter
the
cherished
words
prepared
in
her
soul
when
she
suddenly
turned
pale
opened
her
mouth
and
stared
frieda
frieda
frieda
someone
s
importunate
imploring
voice
cried
in
her
ears
my
name
is
frieda
and
margarita
stumbling
over
the
words
began
to
speak
so
that
means
i
can
ask
for
one
thing
demand
demand
my
donna
woland
replied
smiling
knowingly
you
may
demand
one
thing
ah
how
adroitly
and
distinctly
woland
repeating
margarita
s
words
underscored
that
one
thing
margarita
sighed
again
and
said
i
want
them
to
stop
giving
frieda
that
handkerchief
with
which
she
smothered
her
baby
the
cat
raised
his
eyes
to
heaven
and
sighed
noisily
but
said
nothing
perhaps
remembering
how
his
ear
had
already
suffered
in
view
of
the
fact
said
woland
grinning
that
the
possibility
of
your
having
been
bribed
by
that
fool
frieda
is
of
course
entirely
excluded
being
incompatible
with
your
royal
dignity
i
simply
don
t
know
what
to
do
one
thing
remains
perhaps
to
procure
some
rags
and
stuff
them
in
all
the
cracks
of
my
bedroom
what
are
you
talking
about
messire
margarita
was
amazed
hearing
these
indeed
incomprehensible
words
i
agree
with
you
completely
messire
the
cat
mixed
into
the
conversation
precisely
with
rags
and
the
cat
vexedly
struck
the
table
with
his
paw
i
am
talking
about
mercy
woland
explained
his
words
not
taking
his
fiery
eye
off
margarita
it
sometimes
creeps
quite
unexpectedly
and
perfidiously
through
the
narrowest
cracks
and
so
i
am
talking
about
rags
and
i
m
talking
about
the
same
thing
the
cat
exclaimed
and
drew
back
from
margarita
just
in
case
raising
his
paws
to
protect
his
sharp
ears
covered
with
a
pink
cream
get
out
said
woland
i
haven
t
had
coffee
yet
replied
the
cat
how
can
i
leave
can
it
be
messire
that
on
a
festive
night
the
guests
are
divided
into
two
sorts
one
of
the
first
and
the
other
as
that
sad
skinflint
of
a
barman
put
it
of
second
freshness
quiet
ordered
woland
and
turning
to
margarita
he
asked
you
are
by
all
tokens
a
person
of
exceptional
kindness
a
highly
moral
person
no
margarita
replied
emphatically
i
know
that
one
can
only
speak
frankly
with
you
and
so
i
will
tell
you
frankly
i
am
a
lightminded
person
i
asked
you
for
frieda
only
because
i
was
careless
enough
to
give
her
firm
hope
she
s
waiting
messire
she
believes
in
my
power
and
if
she
s
left
disappointed
i
ll
be
in
a
terrible
position
i
ll
have
no
peace
in
my
life
there
s
no
help
for
it
it
just
happened
ah
said
woland
that
s
understandable
will
you
do
it
margarita
asked
quietly
by
no
means
answered
woland
the
thing
is
dear
queen
that
a
little
confusion
has
taken
place
here
each
department
must
look
after
its
own
affairs
i
don
t
deny
our
possibilities
are
rather
great
they
re
much
greater
than
some
not
very
keen
people
may
think
yes
a
whole
lot
greater
the
cat
obviously
proud
of
these
possibilities
put
in
unable
to
restrain
himself
quiet
devil
take
you
woland
said
to
him
and
went
on
addressing
margarita
but
there
is
simply
no
sense
in
doing
what
ought
to
be
done
by
another
as
i
just
put
it
department
and
so
i
will
not
do
it
but
you
will
do
it
yourself
and
will
it
be
done
at
my
word
azazello
gave
margarita
an
ironic
look
out
of
the
corner
of
his
blind
eye
shook
his
red
head
imperceptibly
and
snorted
just
do
it
what
a
pain
woland
muttered
and
turning
the
globe
began
peering
into
some
detail
on
it
evidently
also
occupied
with
something
else
during
his
conversation
with
margarita
so
frieda
prompted
koroviev
frieda
margarita
cried
piercingly
the
door
flew
open
and
a
dishevelled
naked
woman
now
showing
no
signs
of
drunkenness
ran
into
the
room
with
frenzied
eyes
and
stretched
her
arms
out
to
margarita
who
said
majestically
you
are
forgiven
the
handkerchief
will
no
longer
be
brought
to
you
frieda
s
scream
rang
out
she
fell
face
down
on
the
floor
and
prostrated
in
a
cross
before
margarita
woland
waved
his
hand
and
frieda
vanished
from
sight
thank
you
and
farewell
margarita
said
getting
up
well
behemoth
began
woland
let
s
not
take
advantage
of
the
action
of
an
impractical
person
on
a
festive
night
he
turned
to
margarita
and
so
that
does
not
count
i
did
nothing
what
do
you
want
for
yourself
silence
ensued
interrupted
by
koroviev
who
started
whispering
in
margarita
s
ear
diamond
donna
this
time
i
advise
you
to
be
more
reasonable
or
else
fortune
may
slip
away
i
want
my
beloved
master
to
be
returned
to
me
right
now
this
second
said
margarita
and
her
face
was
contorted
by
a
spasm
here
a
wind
burst
into
the
room
so
that
the
flames
of
the
candles
in
the
candelabra
were
flattened
the
heavy
curtain
on
the
window
moved
aside
the
window
opened
wide
and
revealed
far
away
on
high
a
full
not
morning
but
midnight
moon
a
greenish
kerchief
of
night
light
fell
from
the
windowsill
to
the
floor
and
in
it
appeared
ivanushka
s
night
visitor
who
called
himself
a
master
he
was
in
his
hospital
clothes
robe
slippers
and
the
black
cap
with
which
he
never
parted
his
unshaven
face
twitched
in
a
grimace
he
glanced
sidelong
with
a
crazy
timorousness
at
the
lights
of
the
candles
and
the
torrent
of
moonlight
seethedaround
him
margarita
recognized
him
at
once
gave
a
moan
clasped
her
hands
and
ran
to
him
she
kissed
him
on
the
forehead
on
the
lips
pressed
herself
to
his
stubbly
cheek
and
her
long
heldback
tears
now
streamed
down
her
face
she
uttered
only
one
word
repeating
it
senselessly
you
you
you
the
master
held
her
away
from
him
and
said
in
a
hollow
voice
don
t
weep
margot
don
t
torment
me
i
m
gravely
ill
he
grasped
the
windowsill
with
his
hand
as
if
he
were
about
to
jump
on
to
it
and
flee
and
peering
at
those
sitting
there
cried
i
m
afraid
margot
my
hallucinations
are
beginning
again
sobs
stifled
margarita
she
whispered
choking
on
the
words
no
no
no
don
t
be
afraid
of
anything
i
m
with
you
i
m
with
you
koroviev
deftly
and
inconspicuously
pushed
a
chair
towards
the
master
and
he
sank
into
it
while
margarita
threw
herself
on
her
knees
pressed
herself
to
the
sick
man
s
side
and
so
grew
quiet
in
her
agitation
she
had
not
noticed
that
her
nakedness
was
somehow
suddenly
over
that
she
was
now
wearing
a
black
silk
cloak
the
sick
man
hung
his
head
and
began
looking
down
with
gloomy
sick
eyes
yes
woland
began
after
a
silence
they
did
a
good
job
on
him
he
ordered
koroviev
knight
give
this
man
something
to
drink
margarita
begged
the
master
in
a
trembling
voice
drink
drink
you
re
afraid
no
no
believe
me
they
ll
help
you
the
sick
man
took
the
glass
and
drank
what
was
in
it
but
his
hand
twitched
and
the
lowered
glass
smashed
at
his
feet
it
s
good
luck
good
luck
koroviev
whispered
to
margarita
look
he
s
already
coming
to
himself
indeed
the
sick
man
s
gaze
was
no
longer
so
wild
and
troubled
but
is
it
you
margot
asked
the
moonlit
guest
don
t
doubt
it
s
i
replied
margarita
more
ordered
woland
after
the
master
emptied
the
second
glass
his
eyes
became
alive
and
intelligent
well
there
that
s
something
else
again
said
woland
narrowing
his
eyes
now
let
s
talk
who
are
you
i
m
nobody
now
the
master
replied
and
a
smile
twisted
his
mouth
where
have
you
just
come
from
from
the
house
of
sorrows
i
am
mentally
ill
replied
the
visitor
these
words
margarita
could
not
bear
and
she
began
to
weep
again
then
she
wiped
her
eyes
and
cried
out
terrible
words
terrible
words
he
s
a
master
messire
i
m
letting
you
know
that
cure
him
he
s
worth
it
do
you
know
with
whom
you
are
presently
speaking
woland
asked
the
visitor
on
whom
you
have
come
calling
i
do
replied
the
master
my
neighbour
in
the
madhouse
was
that
boy
ivan
homeless
he
told
me
about
you
ah
yes
yes
woland
responded
i
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
that
young
man
at
the
patriarch
s
ponds
he
almost
drove
me
mad
myself
proving
to
me
that
i
don
t
exist
but
you
do
believe
that
it
is
really
i
i
must
believe
said
the
visitor
though
of
course
it
would
be
much
more
comforting
to
consider
you
the
product
of
a
hallucination
forgive
me
the
master
added
catching
himself
well
so
if
it
s
more
comforting
consider
me
that
woland
replied
courteously
no
no
margarita
said
frightened
shaking
the
master
by
the
shoulder
come
to
your
senses
it
s
really
he
before
you
the
cat
intruded
here
as
well
and
i
really
look
like
a
hallucination
note
my
profile
in
the
moonlight
the
cat
got
into
the
shaft
of
moonlight
and
wanted
to
add
something
else
but
on
being
asked
to
keep
silent
replied
very
well
very
well
i
m
prepared
to
be
silent
i
ll
be
a
silent
hallucination
and
fell
silent
but
tell
me
why
does
margarita
call
you
a
master
asked
woland
the
man
smiled
and
said
that
is
an
excusable
weakness
she
has
too
high
an
opinion
of
a
novel
i
wrote
what
is
this
novel
about
it
is
a
novel
about
pontius
pilate
here
again
the
tongues
of
the
candles
swayed
and
leaped
the
dishes
on
the
table
clattered
woland
burst
into
thunderous
laughter
but
neither
frightened
nor
surprised
anyone
behemoth
applauded
for
some
reason
about
what
about
what
about
whom
said
woland
ceasing
to
laugh
and
that
now
it
s
stupendous
couldn
t
you
have
found
some
other
subject
let
me
see
it
woland
held
out
his
hand
palm
up
unfortunately
i
cannot
do
that
replied
the
master
because
i
burned
it
in
the
stove
forgive
me
but
i
don
t
believe
you
woland
replied
that
cannot
be
manuscripts
don
t
burn
he
turned
to
behemoth
and
said
come
on
behemoth
let
s
have
the
novel
the
cat
instantly
jumped
off
the
chair
and
everyone
saw
that
he
had
been
sitting
on
a
thick
stack
of
manuscripts
with
a
bow
the
cat
gave
the
top
copy
to
woland
margarita
trembled
and
cried
out
again
shaken
to
the
point
of
tears
it
s
here
the
manuscript
it
s
here
she
dashed
to
woland
and
added
in
admiration
allpowerful
allpowerful
woland
took
the
manuscript
that
had
been
handed
to
him
turned
it
over
laid
it
aside
and
silently
without
smiling
stared
at
the
master
but
he
for
some
unknown
reason
lapsed
into
anxiety
and
uneasiness
got
up
from
the
chair
wrung
his
hands
and
quivering
as
he
addressed
the
distant
moon
began
to
murmur
and
at
night
by
moonlight
i
have
no
peace
why
am
i
being
troubled
oh
gods
gods
margarita
clutched
at
the
hospital
robe
pressing
herself
to
him
and
began
to
murmur
herself
in
anguish
and
tears
oh
god
why
doesn
t
the
medicine
help
you
it
s
nothing
nothing
nothing
whispered
koroviev
twisting
about
the
master
nothing
nothing
one
more
little
glass
i
ll
keep
you
company
and
the
little
glass
winked
and
gleamed
in
the
moonlight
and
this
little
glass
helped
the
master
was
put
back
in
his
place
and
the
sick
man
s
face
assumed
a
calm
expression
well
it
s
all
clear
now
said
woland
tapping
the
manuscript
with
a
long
finger
perfectly
clear
confirmed
the
cat
forgetting
his
promise
to
be
a
silent
hallucination
now
the
main
line
of
this
opus
is
thoroughly
clear
to
me
what
do
you
say
azazello
he
turned
to
the
silent
azazello
i
say
the
other
twanged
that
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
drown
you
have
mercy
azazello
the
cat
replied
to
him
and
don
t
suggest
the
idea
to
my
sovereign
believe
me
every
night
i
d
come
to
you
in
the
same
moonlight
garb
as
the
poor
master
and
nod
and
beckon
to
you
to
follow
me
how
would
that

azazello

margarita
woland
again
entered
the
conversation
tell
me
everything
you
need
margarita
s
eyes
lit
up
and
she
said
imploringly
to
woland
allow
me
to
whisper
something
to
him
woland
nodded
his
head
and
margarita
leaning
to
the
master
s
ear
whispered
something
to
him
they
heard
him
answer
her
no

s
too
late
i
want
nothing
more
in
my
life
except
to

but

i
advise

to
leave
me
or

ll
perish
with
me
no
i
won
t

margarita
answered
and
turned
to
woland
i
ask
that
we
be
returned
to
the
basement
in
the
lane
off
the
arbat
and
that
the
lamp
be
burning
and
that
everything
be
as
it
was
here
the
master
laughed
and
embracing
margarita
s
longsinceuncurled
head
said
ah
don
t
listen
to
the
poor
woman
messire
someone
else
has
long
been
living
in
the
basement
and
generally
it
never
happens
that
anything
goes
back
to
what
it
used
to
be
he
put
his
cheek
to
his
friend
s
head
embraced
margarita
and
began
muttering
my
poor
one
my
poor
one
never
happens
you
say
said
woland
that
s
true
but
we
shall
try
and
he
called
out
azazello
at
once
there
dropped
from
the
ceiling
on
to
the
floor
a
bewildered
and
nearly
delirious
citizen
in
nothing
but
his
underwear
though
with
a
suitcase
in
his
hand
for
some
reason
and
wearing
a
cap
this
man
trembled
with
fear
and
kept
cowering
mogarych
azazello
asked
of
the
one
fallen
from
the
sky
aloisy
mogarych
the
man
answered
shivering
was
it
you
who
after
reading
latunsky
s
article
about
this
man
s
novel
wrote
a
denunciation
saying
that
he
kept
illegal
literature
asked
azazello
the
newly
arrived
citizen
turned
blue
and
dissolved
in
tears
of
repentance
you
wanted
to
move
into
his
rooms
azazello
twanged
as
soulfully
as
he
could
the
hissing
of
an
infuriated
cat
was
heard
in
the
room
and
margarita
with
a
howl
of
know
a
witch
when
you
see
one
sank
her
nails
into
aloisy
mogarych
s
face
a
commotion
ensued
what
are
you
doing
the
master
cried
painfully
margot
don
t
disgrace
yourself
i
protest
it
s
not
a
disgrace
shouted
the
cat
koroviev
pulled
margarita
away
i
put
in
a
bathroom
the
bloodied
mogarych
cried
his
teeth
chattering
and
terrified
he
began
pouring
out
some
balderdash
the
whitewashing
alone
the
vitriol
well
it
s
nice
that
you
put
in
a
bathroom
azazello
said
approvingly
he
needs
to
take
baths
and
he
yelled
out
then
mogarych
was
turned
upside
down
and
left
woland
s
bedroom
through
the
open
window
the
master
goggled
his
eyes
whispering
now
that
s
maybe
even
neater
than
what
ivan
described
thoroughly
struck
he
looked
around
and
finally
said
to
the
cat
but
forgive
me
was
it
you
was
it
you
sir
he
faltered
not
knowing
how
to
address
a
cat
are
you
that
same
cat
sir
who
got
on
the
tram
i
am
the
flattered
cat
confirmed
and
added
it
s
pleasing
to
hear
you
address
a
cat
so
politely
for
some
reason
cats
are
usually
addressed
familiarly
though
no
cat
has
ever
drunkbruderchaft
with
anyone
it
seems
to
me
that
you
re
not
so
much
a
cat
the
master
replied
hesitantly
anyway
they
ll
find
me
missing
at
the
hospital
he
added
timidly
to
woland
well
how
are
they
going
to
find
you
missing
koroviev
soothed
him
and
some
papers
and
ledgers
turned
up
in
his
hands
by
your
medical
records
yes
koroviev
flung
the
medical
records
into
the
fireplace
no
papers
no
person
koroviev
said
with
satisfaction
and
this
is
your
landlord
s
house
register
yyes
who
is
registered
in
it
aloisy
mogarych
koroviev
blew
on
the
page
of
the
house
register
hup
two
he
s
not
there
and
i
beg
you
to
notice
never
has
been
and
if
this
landlord
gets
surprised
tell
him
he
dreamed
aloisy
up
mogarych
what
mogarych
there
was
never
any
mogarych
here
the
looseleafed
book
evaporated
from
koroviev
s
hands
and
there
it
is
already
back
in
the
landlord
s
desk
what
you
say
is
true
the
master
observed
struck
by
the
neatness
of
koroviev
s
work
that
if
there
are
no
papers
there
s
no
person
i
have
no
papers
so
there
s
precisely
no
me
i
beg
your
pardon
koroviev
exclaimed
but
that
precisely
is
a
hallucination
your
papers
are
right
here
and
koroviev
handed
the
master
his
papers
then
he
rolled
up
his
eyes
and
whispered
sweetly
to
margarita
and
here
is
your
property
margarita
nikolaevna
and
koroviev
handed
margarita
the
notebook
with
charred
edges
the
dried
rose
the
photograph
and
with
particular
care
the
savings
book
ten
thousand
as
you
kindly
deposited
margarita
nikolaevna
we
don
t
need
what
belongs
to
others
sooner
let
my
paws
wither
than
touch
what
belongs
to
others
the
cat
exclaimed
all
puffed
up
dancing
on
the
suitcase
to
stamp
down
all
the
copies
of
the
illfated
novel
and
your
little
papers
as
well
koroviev
continued
handing
margarita
her
papers
and
then
turning
to
report
deferentially
to
woland
that
s
all
messire
no
not
all
replied
woland
tearing
himself
away
from
the
globe
what
dear
donna
will
you
order
me
to
do
with
your
retinue
i
personally
don
t
need
them
here
the
naked
natasha
ran
through
the
open
door
clasped
her
hands
and
cried
out
to
margarita
be
happy
margarita
nikolaevna
she
nodded
to
the
master
and
again
turned
to
margarita
i
knew
all
about
where
you
used
to
go
domestics
know
everything
observed
the
cat
raising
a
paw
significantly
it
s
a
mistake
to
think
they
re
blind
what
do
you
want
natasha
asked
margarita
go
back
to
the
house
darling
margarita
nikolaevna
natasha
began
imploringly
and
knelt
down
ask
them
she
cast
a
sidelong
glance
at
woland
to
let
me
stay
a
witch
i
don
t
want
any
more
of
that
house
i
won
t
marry
an
engineer
or
a
technician
yesterday
at
the
ball
monsieur
jacques
proposed
to
me
natasha
opened
her
fist
and
showed
some
gold
coins
margarita
turned
a
questioning
look
to
woland
he
nodded
then
natasha
threw
herself
on
margarita
s
neck
gave
her
a
smacking
kiss
and
with
a
victorious
cry
flew
out
the
window
in
natasha
s
place
nikolai
ivanovich
now
stood
he
had
regained
his
former
human
shape
but
was
extremely
glum
and
perhaps
even
annoyed
this
is
someone
i
shall
dismiss
with
special
pleasure
said
woland
looking
at
nikolai
ivanovich
with
disgust
with
exceptional
pleasure
so
superfluous
he
is
here
i
earnestly
beg
that
you
issue
me
a
certificate
nikolai
ivanovich
began
with
great
insistence
but
looking
around
wildly
as
to
where
i
spent
last
night
for
what
purpose
the
cat
asked
sternly
for
the
purpose
of
presenting
it
to
the
police
and
to
my
wife
nikolai
ivanovich
said
firmly
we
normally
don
t
issue
certificates
the
cat
replied
frowning
but
very
well
for
you
we
ll
make
an
exception
and
before
nikolai
ivanovich
had
time
to
gather
his
wits
the
naked
hella
was
sitting
at
a
typewriter
and
the
cat
was
dictating
to
her
it
is
hereby
certified
that
the
bearer
nikolai
ivanovich
spent
the
said
night
at
satan
s
ball
having
been
summoned
there
in
the
capacity
of
a
means
of
transportation
make
a
parenthesis
hella
in
the
parenthesis
put
hog
signed
behemoth
and
the
date
squeaked
nikolai
ivanovich
we
don
t
put
dates
with
a
date
the
document
becomes
invalid
responded
the
cat
setting
his
scrawl
to
it
then
he
got
himself
a
stamp
from
somewhere
breathed
on
it
according
to
all
the
rules
stamped
the
word
payed
on
the
paper
and
handed
it
to
nikolai
ivanovich
after
which
nikolai
ivanovich
disappeared
without
a
trace
and
in
his
place
appeared
a
new
unexpected
guest
and
who
is
this
one
woland
asked
squeamishly
shielding
himself
from
the
candlelight
with
his
hand
varenukha
hung
his
head
sighed
and
said
softly
let
me
go
back
i
can
t
be
a
vampire
i
almost
did
rimsky
in
that
time
with
hella
and
i
m
not
bloodthirsty
let
me
go
what
is
all
this
raving
woland
said
with
a
wince
which
rimsky
what
is
this
nonsense
kindly
do
not
worry
messire
responded
azazello
and
he
turned
to
varenukha
mustn
t
be
rude
on
the
telephone
mustn
t
tell
lies
on
the
telephone
understand
will
you
do
it
again
everything
went
giddy
with
joy
in
varenukha
s
head
his
face
beamed
and
not
knowing
what
he
was
saying
he
began
to
murmur
verily
that
is
i
mean
to
say
your
ma
right
after
dinner
varenukha
pressed
his
hands
to
his
chest
looking
beseechingly
at
azazello
all
right
home
with
you
the
latter
said
and
varenukha
dissolved
now
all
of
you
leave
me
alone
with
them
ordered
woland
pointing
to
the
master
and
margarita
woland
s
order
was
obeyed
instantly
after
some
silence
woland
said
to
the
master
so
it
s
back
to
the
arbat
basement
and
who
is
going
to
write
and
the
dreams
the
inspiration
i
have
no
more
dreams
or
inspiration
either
replied
the
master
no
one
around
me
interests
me
except
her
he
again
put
his
hand
on
margarita
s
head
i
m
broken
i
m
bored
and
i
want
to
be
in
the
basement
and
your
novel
pilate
it
s
hateful
to
me
this
novel
replied
the
master
i
went
through
too
much
because
of
it
i
implore
you
margarita
begged
plaintively
don
t
talk
like
that
why
do
you
torment
me
you
know
i
put
my
whole
life
into
this
work
turning
to
woland
margarita
also
added
don
t
listen
to
him
messire
he
s
too
worn
out
but
you
must
write
about
something
said
woland
if
you
ve
exhausted
the
procurator
well
then
why
not
start
portraying
say
this
aloisy
the
master
smiled
lapshennikova
wouldn
t
publish
that
and
besides
it
s
not
interesting
and
what
are
you
going
to
live
on
you
ll
have
a
beggarly
existence
willingly
willingly
replied
the
master
drawing
margarita
to
him
he
put
his
arm
around
her
shoulders
and
added
she
ll
see
reason
she
ll
leave
me
i
doubt
that
woland
said
through
his
teeth
and
went
on
and
so
the
man
who
wrote
the
story
of
pontius
pilate
goes
to
the
basement
with
the
intention
of
settling
by
the
lamp
and
leading
a
beggarly
existence
margarita
separated
herself
from
the
master
and
began
speaking
very
ardently
i
did
all
i
could
i
whispered
the
most
tempting
thing
to
him
and
he
refused
i
know
what
you
whispered
to
him
woland
retorted
but
it
is
not
the
most
tempting
thing
and
to
you
i
say
he
turned
smiling
to
the
master
that
your
novel
will
still
bring
you
surprises
that
s
very
sad
replied
the
master
no
no
it
s
not
sad
said
woland
nothing
terrible
well
margarita
nikolaevna
it
has
all
been
done
do
you
have
any
claims
against
me
how
can
you
oh
how
can
you
messire
then
take
this
from
me
as
a
memento
said
woland
and
he
drew
from
under
the
pillow
a
small
golden
horseshoe
studded
with
diamonds
no
no
no
why
on
earth
you
want
to
argue
with
me
woland
said
smiling
since
margarita
had
no
pockets
in
her
cloak
she
put
the
horseshoe
in
a
napkin
and
tied
it
into
a
knot
here
something
amazed
her
she
looked
at
the
window
through
which
the
moon
was
shining
and
said
and
here
s
something
i
don
t
understand
how
is
it
midnight
midnight
when
it
should
have
been
morning
long
ago
it
s
nice
to
prolong
the
festive
night
a
little
replied
woland
well
i
wish
you
happiness
margarita
prayerfully
reached
out
both
hands
to
woland
but
did
not
dare
approach
him
and
softly
exclaimed
farewell
farewell
goodbye
said
woland
and
margarita
in
the
black
cloak
the
master
in
the
hospital
robe
they
walked
out
to
the
corridor
of
the
jeweller
s
wife
s
apartment
where
a
candle
was
burning
and
woland
s
retinue
was
waiting
for
them
when
they
left
the
corridor
hella
was
carrying
the
suitcase
containing
the
novel
and
margarita
nikolaevna
s
few
possessions
and
the
cat
was
helping
hella
at
the
door
of
the
apartment
koroviev
made
his
bows
and
disappeared
while
the
rest
went
to
accompany
them
downstairs
the
stairway
was
empty
as
they
passed
the
thirdfloor
landing
something
thudded
softly
but
no
one
paid
any
attention
to
it
just
at
the
exit
from
the
sixth
stairway
azazello
blew
upwards
and
as
soon
as
they
came
out
to
the
courtyard
where
the
moonlight
did
not
reach
they
saw
a
man
in
a
cap
and
boots
asleep
and
obviously
dead
asleep
on
the
doorstep
as
well
as
a
big
black
car
by
the
entrance
with
its
lights
turned
off
through
the
windshield
could
be
dimly
seen
the
silhouette
of
a
rook
they
were
just
about
to
get
in
when
margarita
cried
softly
in
despair
oh
god
i
ve
lost
the
horseshoe
get
into
the
car
said
azazello
and
wait
for
me
i
ll
be
right
back
i
only
have
to
see
what
s
happened
and
he
went
back
in
what
had
happened
was
the
following
shortly
before
margarita
and
the
master
left
with
their
escort
a
little
driedup
woman
carrying
a
can
and
a
bag
came
out
of
apartment
no
which
was
located
just
under
the
jeweller
s
wife
s
apartment
this
was
that
same
annushka
who
on
wednesday
to
berlioz
s
misfortune
had
spilled
sunflower
oil
by
the
turnstile
no
one
knew
and
probably
no
one
will
ever
know
what
this
woman
did
in
moscow
or
how
she
maintained
her
existence
the
only
thing
known
about
her
is
that
she
could
be
seen
every
day
either
with
the
can
or
with
bag
and
can
together
in
the
kerosene
shop
or
in
the
market
or
under
the
gateway
or
on
the
stairs
but
most
often
in
the
kitchen
of
apartment
no
of
which
this
annushka
was
one
of
the
tenants
besides
that
and
above
all
it
was
known
that
wherever
she
was
or
wherever
she
appeared
a
scandal
would
at
once
break
out
and
besides
that
she
bore
the
nickname
of
the
plague
annushka
the
plague
always
got
up
very
early
for
some
reason
and
today
something
got
her
up
in
the
wee
hours
just
past
midnight
the
key
turned
in
the
door
annushka
s
nose
stuck
out
of
it
then
the
whole
of
her
stuck
out
she
slammed
the
door
behind
her
and
was
about
to
set
off
somewhere
when
a
door
banged
on
the
landing
above
someone
hurtled
down
the
stairs
and
bumping
into
annushka
flung
her
aside
so
that
she
struck
the
back
of
her
head
against
the
wall
where
s
the
devil
taking
you
in
nothing
but
your
underpants
annushka
shrieked
clutching
her
head
the
man
in
nothing
but
his
underwear
carrying
a
suitcase
and
wearing
a
cap
his
eyes
shut
answered
annushka
in
a
wild
sleepy
voice
the
boiler
the
vitriol
the
cost
of
the
whitewashing
alone
and
bursting
into
tears
he
barked
out
here
he
dashed
not
further
down
but
back
up
to
where
the
window
had
been
broken
by
the
economist
s
foot
and
out
this
window
he
flew
legs
up
into
the
courtyard
annushka
even
forgot
about
her
head
gasped
and
rushed
to
the
window
herself
she
lay
down
on
her
stomach
on
the
landing
and
stuck
her
head
into
the
yard
expecting
to
see
the
man
with
the
suitcase
smashed
to
death
on
the
asphalt
lit
up
by
the
courtyard
lantern
but
on
the
asphalt
courtyard
there
was
precisely
nothing
it
only
remained
to
suppose
that
a
sleepy
and
strange
person
had
flown
out
of
the
house
like
a
bird
leaving
not
a
trace
behind
him
annushka
crossed
herself
and
thought
yes
indeed
a
nice
little
apartment
that
number
fifty
it
s
not
for
nothing
people
say
oh
a
nice
little
apartment
before
she
had
time
to
think
it
through
the
door
upstairs
slammed
again
and
a
second
someone
came
running
down
annushka
pressed
herself
to
the
wall
and
saw
a
rather
respectable
citizen
with
a
little
beard
but
as
it
seemed
to
annushka
with
a
slightly
piggish
face
dart
past
her
and
like
the
first
one
leave
the
house
through
the
window
again
without
ever
thinking
of
smashing
himself
on
the
asphalt
annushka
had
already
forgotten
the
purpose
of
her
outing
and
stayed
on
the
stairway
crossing
herself
gasping
and
talking
to
herself
a
third
one
without
a
little
beard
with
a
round
cleanshaven
face
in
a
tolstoy
blouse
came
running
down
a
short
while
later
and
fluttered
out
the
window
in
just
the
same
way
to
annushka
s
credit
it
must
be
said
that
she
was
inquisitive
and
decided
to
wait
and
see
whether
any
new
miracles
would
occur
the
door
above
was
opened
again
and
now
a
whole
company
started
down
not
at
a
run
but
normally
as
everybody
walks
annushka
darted
away
from
the
window
went
to
her
own
door
opened
it
in
a
trice
hid
behind
it
and
her
eye
frenzied
with
curiosity
glittered
in
the
chink
she
left
for
herself
someone
possibly
sick
or
possibly
not
but
strange
pale
with
a
stubbly
beard
in
a
black
cap
and
some
sort
of
robe
walked
down
with
unsteady
steps
he
was
led
carefully
under
the
arm
by
a
lady
in
a
black
cassock
as
it
seemed
to
annushka
in
the
darkness
the
lady
was
possibly
barefoot
possibly
wearing
some
sort
of
transparent
obviously
imported
shoes
that
were
torn
to
shreds
pah
shoes
my
eye
the
lady
is
naked
yes
the
cassock
has
been
thrown
right
over
her
naked
body
a
nice
little
apartment
everything
in
annushka
s
soul
sang
in
anticipation
of
what
she
was
going
to
tell
the
neighbours
the
next
day
the
strangely
dressed
lady
was
followed
by
a
completely
naked
one
carrying
a
suitcase
and
next
to
the
suitcase
a
huge
black
cat
was
knocking
about
annushka
almost
squeaked
something
out
loud
rubbing
her
eyes
bringing
up
the
rear
of
the
procession
was
a
short
limping
foreigner
blind
in
one
eye
without
a
jacket
in
a
white
formal
waistcoat
and
tie
this
whole
company
marched
downstairs
past
annushka
here
something
thudded
on
the
landing
as
the
steps
died
away
annushka
slipped
like
a
snake
from
behind
the
door
put
the
can
down
by
the
wall
dropped
to
the
floor
on
her
stomach
and
began
feeling
around
her
hands
came
upon
a
napkin
with
something
heavy
in
it
annushka
s
eyes
started
out
of
her
head
when
she
unwrapped
the
package
annushka
kept
bringing
the
precious
thing
right
up
to
her
eyes
and
these
eyes
burned
with
a
perfectly
wolfish
fire
a
whirlwind
formed
in
annushka
s
head
i
see
nothing
i
know
nothing
to
my
nephew
or
cut
it
in
pieces
i
could
pick
the
stones
out
and
then
one
by
one
one
to
petrovka
another
to
smolensky
and
i
see
nothing
i
know
nothing
annushka
hid
the
found
object
in
her
bosom
grabbed
the
can
and
was
about
to
slip
back
into
her
apartment
postponing
her
trip
to
town
when
that
same
one
with
the
white
chest
without
a
jacket
emerged
before
her
from
devil
knows
where
and
quietly
whispered
give
me
the
horseshoe
and
napkin
what
napkin
horseshoe
annushka
asked
shamming
very
artfully
i
don
t
know
about
any
napkins
are
you
drunk
citizen
or
what
with
fingers
as
hard
as
the
handrails
of
a
bus
and
as
cold
the
whitechested
one
without
another
word
squeezed
annushka
s
throat
so
that
he
completely
stopped
all
access
of
air
to
her
chest
the
can
dropped
from
annushka
s
hand
on
to
the
floor
after
keeping
annushka
without
air
for
some
time
the
jacketless
foreigner
removed
his
fingers
from
her
throat
gulping
air
annushka
smiled
ah
the
little
horseshoe
she
said
this
very
second
so
it
s
your
little
horseshoe
and
i
see
it
lying
there
in
a
napkin
i
pick
it
up
so
that
no
one
takes
it
and
then
just
try
finding
it
having
received
the
little
horseshoe
and
napkin
the
foreigner
started
bowing
and
scraping
before
annushka
shook
her
hand
firmly
and
thanked
her
warmly
with
the
strongest
of
foreign
accents
in
the
following
terms
i
am
deeply
grateful
to
you
ma
am
this
little
horseshoe
is
dear
to
me
as
a
memento
and
for
having
preserved
it
allow
me
to
give
you
two
hundred
roubles
and
he
took
the
money
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
at
once
and
handed
it
to
annushka
she
smiling
desperately
could
only
keep
exclaiming
ah
i
humbly
thank
you
merci
merci
the
generous
foreigner
cleared
a
whole
flight
of
stairs
in
one
leap
but
before
decamping
definitively
shouted
from
below
now
without
any
accent
you
old
witch
if
you
ever
pick
up
somebody
else
s
stuff
again
take
it
to
the
police
don
t
hide
it
in
your
bosom
feeling
a
ringing
and
commotion
in
her
head
from
all
these
events
on
the
stairs
annushka
went
on
shouting
for
some
time
by
inertia
merci
merci
merci
but
the
foreigner
was
long
gone
and
so
was
the
car
in
the
courtyard
having
returned
woland
s
gift
to
margarita
azazello
said
goodbye
to
her
and
asked
if
she
was
comfortably
seated
hella
exchanged
smacking
kisses
with
margarita
the
cat
kissed
her
hand
everyone
waved
to
the
master
who
collapsed
lifelessly
and
motionlessly
in
the
corner
of
the
seat
waved
to
the
rook
and
at
once
melted
into
air
considering
it
unnecessary
to
take
the
trouble
of
climbing
the
stairs
the
rook
turned
the
lights
on
and
rolled
out
through
the
gates
past
the
man
lying
dead
asleep
under
the
archway
and
the
lights
of
the
big
black
car
disappeared
among
the
other
lights
on
sleepless
and
noisy
sadovaya
an
hour
later
in
the
basement
of
the
small
house
in
the
lane
off
the
arbat
in
the
front
room
where
everything
was
the
same
as
it
had
been
before
that
terrible
autumn
night
last
year
at
the
table
covered
with
a
velvet
tablecloth
under
the
shaded
lamp
near
which
stood
a
little
vase
of
lilies
of
the
valley
margarita
sat
and
wept
quietly
from
the
shock
she
had
experienced
and
from
happiness
the
notebook
disfigured
by
fire
lay
before
her
and
next
to
it
rose
a
pile
of
intact
notebooks
the
little
house
was
silent
on
a
sofa
in
the
small
adjoining
room
covered
with
the
hospital
robe
the
master
lay
in
a
deep
sleep
his
even
breathing
was
noiseless
having
wept
her
fill
margarita
went
to
the
intact
notebooks
and
found
the
place
she
had
been
rereading
before
she
met
azazello
under
the
kremlin
wall
margarita
did
not
want
to
sleep
she
caressed
the
manuscript
tenderly
as
one
caresses
a
favourite
cat
and
kept
turning
it
in
her
hands
examining
it
from
all
sides
now
pausing
at
the
title
page
now
opening
to
the
end
a
terrible
thought
suddenly
swept
over
her
that
this
was
all
sorcery
that
the
notebooks
would
presently
disappear
from
sight
and
she
would
be
in
her
bedroom
in
the
old
house
and
that
on
waking
up
she
would
have
to
go
and
drown
herself
but
this
was
her
last
terrible
thought
an
echo
of
the
long
suffering
she
had
lived
through
nothing
disappeared
the
allpowerful
woland
really
was
all
powerful
and
as
long
as
she
liked
even
till
dawn
itself
margarita
could
rustle
the
pages
of
the
notebooks
gaze
at
them
kiss
them
and
read
over
the
words
the
darkness
that
came
from
the
mediterranean
sea
covered
the
city
hated
by
the
procurator
yes
the
darkness
chapter
how
the
procurator
tried
to
save
judas
of
kiriath
the
darkness
that
came
from
the
mediterranean
sea
covered
the
city
hated
by
the
procurator
the
hanging
bridges
connecting
the
temple
with
the
dread
antonia
tower
disappeared
the
abyss
descended
from
the
sky
and
flooded
the
winged
gods
over
the
hippodrome
the
hasmonaean
palace
with
its
loopholes
the
bazaars
caravanserais
lanes
pools
yershalaim
the
great
city
vanished
as
if
it
had
never
existed
in
the
world
everything
was
devoured
by
the
darkness
which
frightened
every
living
thing
in
yershalaim
and
round
about
the
strange
cloud
was
swept
from
seaward
towards
the
end
of
the
day
the
fourteenth
day
of
the
spring
month
of
nisan
it
was
already
heaving
its
belly
over
bald
skull
where
the
executioners
hastily
stabbed
the
condemned
men
it
heaved
itself
over
the
temple
of
yershalaim
crept
in
smoky
streams
down
the
temple
hill
and
flooded
the
lower
city
it
poured
through
windows
and
drove
people
from
the
crooked
streets
into
the
houses
it
was
in
no
hurry
to
yield
up
its
moisture
and
gave
off
only
light
each
time
the
black
smoky
brew
was
ripped
by
fire
the
great
bulk
of
the
temple
with
its
glittering
scaly
roof
flew
up
out
of
the
pitch
darkness
but
the
fire
would
instantly
go
out
and
the
temple
would
sink
into
the
dark
abyss
time
and
again
it
grew
out
of
it
and
fell
back
and
each
time
its
collapse
was
accompanied
by
the
thunder
of
catastrophe
other
tremulous
glimmers
called
out
of
the
abyss
the
palace
of
herod
the
great
standing
opposite
the
temple
on
the
western
hill
and
its
dread
eyeless
golden
statues
flew
up
into
the
black
sky
stretching
their
arms
out
to
it
but
again
the
heavenly
fire
would
hide
and
heavy
claps
of
thunder
would
drive
the
golden
idols
into
the
darkness
the
downpour
burst
unexpectedly
and
then
the
storm
turned
into
a
hurricane
in
the
very
place
where
the
procurator
and
the
high
priest
had
had
their
talk
around
noon
by
the
marble
bench
in
the
garden
with
the
sound
of
a
cannon
shot
a
cypress
snapped
like
a
reed
along
with
the
watery
spray
and
hail
brokenoff
roses
magnolia
leaves
small
twigs
and
sand
were
swept
on
to
the
balcony
under
the
columns
the
hurricane
racked
the
garden
at
that
time
there
was
only
one
man
under
the
columns
and
that
man
was
the
procurator
now
he
was
not
sitting
in
the
chair
but
lying
on
a
couch
by
a
small
low
table
set
with
food
and
jugs
of
wine
another
couch
empty
stood
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
by
the
procurator
s
feet
spread
an
unwiped
red
puddle
as
if
of
blood
with
pieces
of
a
broken
jug
the
servant
who
was
setting
the
table
for
the
procurator
before
the
storm
became
disconcerted
for
some
reason
under
his
gaze
grew
alarmed
at
having
displeased
him
in
some
way
and
the
procurator
getting
angry
with
him
smashed
the
jug
on
the
mosaic
floor
saying
why
don
t
you
look
me
in
the
face
when
you
serve
me
have
you
stolen
something
the
african
s
black
face
turned
grey
mortal
fear
showed
in
his
eyes
he
trembled
and
almost
broke
a
second
jug
but
the
procurator
s
wrath
flew
away
as
quickly
as
it
had
flown
in
the
african
rushed
to
remove
the
pieces
and
wipe
up
the
puddle
but
the
procurator
waved
his
hand
and
the
slave
ran
away
thepuddle
remained
now
during
the
hurricane
the
african
was
hiding
near
a
niche
in
which
stood
the
statue
of
a
white
naked
woman
with
a
drooping
head
afraid
of
appearing
before
the
procurator
s
eyes
at
the
wrong
time
and
at
the
same
time
fearing
to
miss
the
moment
when
the
procurator
might
call
for
him
lying
on
the
couch
in
the
storm
s
twilight
the
procurator
poured
wine
into
the
cup
himself
drank
it
in
long
draughts
occasionally
touched
the
bread
crumbled
it
swallowed
small
pieces
sucked
out
an
oyster
from
time
to
time
chewed
a
lemon
and
drank
again
had
it
not
been
for
the
roaring
of
the
water
had
it
not
been
for
the
thunderclaps
that
seemed
to
threaten
to
lay
flat
the
roof
of
the
palace
had
it
not
been
for
the
rattle
of
hail
hammering
on
the
steps
of
the
balcony
one
might
have
heard
that
the
procurator
was
muttering
something
talking
to
himself
and
if
the
unsteady
glimmering
of
the
heavenly
fire
had
turned
into
a
constant
light
an
observer
would
have
been
able
to
see
that
the
procurator
s
face
with
eyes
inflamed
by
recent
insomnia
and
wine
showed
impatience
that
the
procurator
was
not
only
looking
at
the
two
white
roses
drowned
in
the
red
puddle
but
constantly
turned
his
face
towards
the
garden
meeting
the
watery
spray
and
sand
that
he
was
waiting
for
someone
impatientlywaiting
time
passed
and
the
veil
of
water
before
the
procurator
s
eyes
began
to
thin
furious
as
it
was
the
hurricane
was
weakening
branches
no
longer
cracked
and
fell
the
thunderclaps
and
flashes
came
less
frequently
it
was
no
longer
a
violet
coverlet
trimmed
with
white
but
an
ordinary
grey
rearguard
cloud
that
floated
over
yershalaim
the
storm
was
being
swept
towards
the
dead
sea
now
it
was
possible
to
hear
separately
the
noise
of
the
rain
and
the
noise
of
water
rushing
along
the
gutters
and
also
straight
down
the
steps
of
that
stairway
upon
which
the
procurator
had
walked
in
the
afternoon
to
announce
the
sentence
in
the
square
and
finally
the
hitherto
drownedout
fountain
made
itself
heard
it
was
growing
lighter
blue
windows
appeared
in
the
grey
veil
fleeing
eastward
here
from
far
off
breaking
through
the
patter
of
the
now
quite
weakened
rainfall
there
came
to
the
procurator
s
ears
a
weak
sound
of
trumpets
and
the
tapping
of
several
hundred
hoofs
hearing
this
the
procurator
stirred
and
his
face
livened
up
the
ala
was
coming
back
from
bald
mountain
judging
by
the
sound
it
was
passing
through
the
same
square
where
the
sentence
had
been
announced
at
last
the
procurator
heard
the
longawaited
footsteps
and
a
slapping
on
the
stairs
leading
to
the
upper
terrace
of
the
garden
just
in
front
of
the
balcony
the
procurator
stretched
his
neck
and
his
eyes
glinted
with
an
expression
of
joy
between
the
two
marble
lions
there
appeared
first
a
hooded
head
then
a
completely
drenched
man
with
his
cloak
clinging
to
his
body
it
was
the
same
man
who
had
exchanged
whispers
with
the
procurator
in
a
darkened
room
of
the
palace
before
the
sentencing
and
who
during
the
execution
had
sat
on
a
threelegged
stool
playing
with
a
twig
heedless
of
puddles
the
man
in
the
hood
crossed
the
garden
terrace
stepped
on
to
the
mosaic
floor
of
the
balcony
and
raising
his
arm
said
in
a
high
pleasant
voice
health
and
joy
to
the
procurator
the
visitor
spoke
in
latin
gods
exclaimed
pilate
there
s
not
a
dry
stitch
on
you
what
a
hurricane
eh
i
beg
you
to
go
inside
immediately
do
me
a
favour
and
change
your
clothes
the
visitor
threw
back
his
hood
revealing
a
completely
wet
head
with
hair
plastered
to
the
forehead
and
showing
a
polite
smile
on
his
cleanshaven
face
began
refusing
to
change
insisting
that
a
little
rain
would
not
hurt
him
i
won
t
hear
of
it
pilate
replied
and
clapped
his
hands
with
that
he
called
out
the
servants
who
were
hiding
from
him
and
told
them
to
take
care
of
the
visitor
and
then
serve
the
hot
course
immediately
the
procurator
s
visitor
required
very
little
time
to
dry
his
hair
change
his
clothes
and
shoes
and
generally
put
himself
in
order
and
he
soon
appeared
on
the
balcony
in
dry
sandals
a
dry
crimson
military
cloak
and
with
slickeddown
hair
just
then
the
sun
returned
to
yershalaim
and
before
going
to
drown
in
the
mediterranean
sea
sent
farewell
rays
to
the
city
hated
by
the
procurator
and
gilded
the
steps
of
the
balcony
the
fountain
revived
completely
and
sang
away
with
all
its
might
doves
came
out
on
the
sand
cooing
hopping
over
broken
branches
pecking
at
something
in
the
wet
sand
the
red
puddle
was
wiped
up
the
broken
pieces
were
removed
meat
steamed
on
the
table
i
wait
to
hear
the
procurator
s
orders
said
the
visitor
approaching
the
table
but
you
won
t
hear
anything
until
you
sit
down
and
drink
some
wine
pilate
replied
courteously
and
pointed
to
the
other
couch
the
visitor
reclined
a
servant
poured
some
thick
red
wine
into
his
cup
another
servant
leaning
cautiously
over
pilate
s
shoulder
filled
the
procurator
s
cup
after
that
he
motioned
for
the
two
servants
to
withdraw
while
the
visitor
drank
and
ate
pilate
sipping
his
wine
kept
glancing
with
narrowed
eyes
at
his
guest
the
man
who
had
come
to
pilate
was
middleaged
with
a
very
pleasant
rounded
and
neat
face
and
a
fleshy
mouth
his
hair
was
of
some
indeterminate
colour
now
as
it
dried
it
became
lighter
it
would
be
difficult
to
establish
the
man
s
nationality
the
chief
determinant
of
his
face
was
perhaps
its
goodnatured
expression
which
however
was
not
in
accord
with
his
eyes
or
rather
not
his
eyes
but
the
visitor
s
way
of
looking
at
his
interlocutor
ordinarily
he
kept
his
small
eyes
under
his
lowered
somewhat
strange
as
ifslightly
swollen
eyelids
then
the
slits
of
these
eyes
shone
with
an
unspiteful
slyness
it
must
be
supposed
that
the
procurator
s
guest
had
a
propensity
for
humour
but
occasionally
driving
this
glittering
humour
from
the
slits
entirely
the
procurator
s
present
guest
would
open
his
eyelids
wide
and
look
at
his
interlocutor
suddenly
and
pointblank
as
if
with
the
purpose
of
rapidly
scrutinizing
some
inconspicuous
spot
on
his
interlocutor
s
nose
this
lasted
only
an
instant
after
which
the
eyelids
would
lower
again
the
slits
would
narrow
and
once
again
they
would
begin
to
shine
with
goodnaturedness
and
sly
intelligence
the
visitor
did
not
decline
a
second
cup
of
wine
swallowed
a
few
oysters
with
obvious
pleasure
tried
some
steamed
vegetables
ate
a
piece
of
meat
having
eaten
his
fill
he
praised
the
wine
an
excellent
vintage
procurator
but
it
is
not
falerno
caecuba
thirty
years
old
the
procurator
replied
courteously
the
guest
put
his
hand
to
his
heart
declined
to
eat
more
declared
that
he
was
full
then
pilate
filled
his
own
cup
and
the
guest
did
the
same
both
diners
poured
some
wine
from
their
cups
on
to
the
meat
platter
and
the
procurator
raising
his
cup
said
loudly
for
us
for
thee
caesar
father
of
the
romans
best
and
dearest
of
men
after
this
they
finished
the
wine
and
the
africans
removed
the
food
from
the
table
leaving
the
fruit
and
the
jugs
again
the
procurator
motioned
for
the
servants
to
withdraw
and
remained
alone
with
his
guest
under
the
colonnade
and
so
pilate
began
in
a
low
voice
what
can
you
tell
me
about
the
mood
of
this
city
he
inadvertently
turned
his
eyes
to
where
the
colonnades
and
flat
roofs
below
beyond
the
terraces
of
the
garden
were
drying
out
gilded
by
the
last
rays
i
believe
procurator
the
guest
replied
that
the
mood
of
yershalaim
is
now
satisfactory
so
it
can
be
guaranteed
that
there
is
no
threat
of
further
disorders
only
one
thing
can
be
guaranteed
in
this
world
the
guest
replied
glancing
tenderly
at
the
procurator
the
power
of
great
caesar
may
the
gods
grant
him
long
life
pilate
picked
up
at
once
and
universal
peace
he
paused
and
then
continued
so
you
believe
the
troops
can
now
be
withdrawn
i
believe
that
the
cohort
of
the
lightning
legion
can
go
the
guest
replied
and
added
it
would
be
good
if
it
paraded
through
the
city
in
farewell
a
very
good
thought
the
procurator
approved
i
will
dismiss
it
the
day
after
tomorrow
and
go
myself
and
i
swear
to
you
by
the
feast
of
the
twelve
gods
by
the
lares
i
swear
i
d
give
a
lot
to
be
able
to
do
so
today
the
procurator
doesn
t
like
yershalaim
the
guest
asked
goodnaturedly
good
heavens
the
procurator
exclaimed
smiling
there
s
no
more
hopeless
place
on
earth
i
m
not
even
speaking
of
natural
conditions
i
get
sick
every
time
i
have
to
come
here
but
that
s
only
half
the
trouble
but
these
feasts
magicians
sorcerers
wizards
these
flocks
of
pilgrims
fanatics
fanatics
just
take
this
messiah
they
suddenly
started
expecting
this
year
every
moment
you
think
you
re
about
to
witness
the
most
unpleasant
bloodshed
the
shifting
of
troops
all
the
time
reading
denunciations
and
calumnies
half
of
which
moreover
are
written
against
yourself
you
must
agree
it
s
boring
oh
if
it
weren
t
for
the
imperial
service
yes
the
feasts
are
hard
here
agreed
the
guest
i
wish
with
all
my
heart
that
they
should
be
over
soon
pilate
added
energetically
i
will
finally
have
the
possibility
of
going
back
to
caesarea
believe
me
this
delirious
construction
of
herod
s
the
procurator
waved
his
arm
along
the
colonnade
to
make
clear
that
he
was
speaking
of
the
palace
positively
drives
me
out
of
my
mind
i
cannot
spend
my
nights
in
it
the
world
has
never
known
a
stranger
architecture
well
but
let
s
get
back
to
business
first
of
all
this
cursed
barrabban
you
re
not
worried
about
him
and
here
the
guest
sent
his
peculiar
glance
at
the
procurator
s
cheek
but
the
latter
frowning
squeamishly
gazed
into
the
distance
with
bored
eyes
contemplating
the
part
of
the
city
that
lay
at
his
feet
and
was
fading
into
the
twilight
the
guest
s
eyes
also
faded
and
his
eyelids
lowered
it
may
be
supposed
that
bar
has
now
become
as
harmless
as
a
lamb
the
guest
began
to
say
and
wrinkles
appeared
on
his
round
face
it
would
be
awkward
for
him
to
rebel
now
too
famous
pilate
asked
with
a
smirk
the
procurator
has
subtly
understood
the
problem
as
always
but
in
any
case
the
procurator
observed
with
concern
and
the
thin
long
finger
with
the
black
stone
of
its
ring
was
raised
there
must
be
oh
the
procurator
can
be
certain
that
as
long
as
i
am
in
judea
bar
will
not
take
a
step
without
having
someone
on
his
heels
now
i
am
at
peace
as
i
always
am
incidentally
when
you
are
here
the
procurator
is
too
kind
and
now
i
ask
you
to
tell
me
about
the
execution
said
the
procurator
what
precisely
interests
the
procurator
were
there
any
attempts
on
the
part
of
the
crowd
to
display
rebelliousness
that
is
the
main
thing
of
course
none
replied
the
guest
very
good
did
you
personally
establish
that
death
took
place
the
procurator
may
be
certain
of
it
and
tell
me
were
they
given
the
drink
before
being
hung
on
the
posts
yes
but
he
here
the
guest
closed
his
eyes
refused
to
drink
it
who
precisely
asked
pilate
forgive
me
hegemon
the
guest
exclaimed
did
i
not
name
him
hanozri
madman
said
pilate
grimacing
for
some
reason
a
little
nerve
began
to
twitch
under
his
left
eye
to
die
of
sunburn
why
refuse
what
is
offered
by
law
in
what
terms
did
he
refuse
it
he
said
the
guest
answered
again
closing
his
eyes
that
he
was
grateful
and
laid
no
blame
for
the
taking
of
his
life
on
whom
pilate
asked
in
a
hollow
voice
that
he
did
not
say
hegemon
did
he
try
to
preach
anything
in
the
soldiers
presence
no
hegemon
he
was
not
loquacious
this
time
the
only
thing
he
said
was
that
among
human
vices
he
considered
cowardice
one
of
the
first
this
was
said
with
regard
to
what
the
guest
heard
a
suddenly
cracked
voice
that
was
impossible
to
understand
he
generally
behaved
himself
strangely
as
always
however
what
was
this
strangeness
he
kept
trying
to
peer
into
the
eyes
of
one
or
another
of
those
around
him
and
kept
smiling
some
sort
of
lost
smile
nothing
else
asked
the
hoarse
voice
nothing
else
the
procurator
knocked
against
the
cup
as
he
poured
himself
some
wine
after
draining
it
to
the
very
bottom
he
spoke
the
matter
consists
in
the
following
though
we
have
been
unable
so
far
at
least
to
discover
any
admirers
or
followers
of
his
it
is
none
the
less
impossible
to
guarantee
that
there
are
none
the
guest
listened
attentively
inclining
his
head
and
so
to
avoid
surprises
of
any
sort
the
procurator
continued
i
ask
you
to
remove
the
bodies
of
all
three
executed
men
from
the
face
of
the
earth
immediately
and
without
any
noise
and
to
bury
them
in
secrecy
and
silence
so
that
not
another
word
or
whisper
is
heard
of
them
understood
hegemon
replied
the
guest
and
he
got
up
saying
in
view
of
the
complexity
and
responsibility
of
the
matter
allow
me
to
go
immediately
no
sit
down
again
said
pilate
stopping
his
guest
with
a
gesture
there
are
two
more
questions
first
your
enormous
merits
in
this
most
difficult
job
at
the
post
of
head
of
the
secret
service
for
the
procurator
of
judea
give
me
the
pleasant
opportunity
of
reporting
them
to
rome
here
the
guest
s
face
turned
pink
he
rose
and
bowed
to
the
procurator
saying
i
merely
fulfil
my
duty
in
the
imperial
service
but
i
wanted
to
ask
you
the
hegemon
continued
in
case
you
re
offered
a
transfer
elsewhere
with
a
raise
to
decline
it
and
remain
here
i
wouldn
t
want
to
part
with
you
for
anything
let
them
reward
you
in
some
other
way
i
am
happy
to
serve
under
your
command
hegemon
that
pleases
me
very
much
and
so
the
second
question
it
concerns
this
what
s
his
name
judas
of
kiriath
here
the
guest
sent
the
procurator
his
glance
and
at
once
as
was
his
custom
extinguished
it
they
say
the
procurator
continued
lowering
his
voice
that
he
supposedly
got
some
money
for
receiving
this
madman
so
cordially
will
get
the
head
of
the
secret
service
quietly
corrected
pilate
and
is
it
a
large
sum
that
no
one
can
say
hegemon
not
even
you
said
the
hegemon
expressing
praise
by
his
amazement
alas
not
even
i
the
guest
calmly
replied
but
he
will
get
the
money
this
evening
that
i
do
know
he
is
to
be
summoned
tonight
to
the
palace
of
kaifa
ah
that
greedy
old
man
of
kiriath
the
procurator
observed
smiling
he
is
an
old
man
isn
t
he
the
procurator
is
never
mistaken
but
he
is
mistaken
this
time
the
guest
replied
courteously
the
man
from
kiriath
is
a
young
man
you
don
t
say
can
you
describe
his
character
for
me
a
fanatic
oh
no
procurator
so
and
anything
else
very
handsome
what
else
he
has
some
passion
perhaps
it
is
difficult
to
have
such
precise
knowledge
about
everyone
in
this
huge
city
procurator
ah
no
no
aphranius
don
t
play
down
your
merits
he
has
one
passion
procurator
the
guest
made
a
tiny
pause
a
passion
for
money
and
what
is
his
occupation
aphranius
raised
his
eyes
thought
and
replied
he
works
in
the
moneychanging
shop
of
one
of
his
relatives
ah
so
so
so
so
here
the
procurator
fell
silent
looked
around
to
be
sure
there
was
no
one
on
the
balcony
and
then
said
quietly
the
thing
is
this
i
have
just
received
information
that
he
is
going
to
be
killed
tonight
this
time
the
guest
not
only
cast
his
glance
at
the
procurator
but
even
held
it
briefly
and
after
that
replied
you
spoke
too
flatteringly
of
me
procurator
in
my
opinion
i
do
not
deserve
your
report
this
information
i
do
not
have
you
deserve
the
highest
reward
the
procurator
replied
but
there
is
such
information
may
i
be
so
bold
as
to
ask
who
supplied
it
permit
me
not
to
say
for
the
time
being
the
more
so
as
it
is
accidental
obscure
and
uncertain
but
it
is
my
duty
to
foresee
everything
that
is
my
job
and
most
of
all
i
must
trust
my
presentiment
for
it
has
never
yet
deceived
me
the
information
is
that
one
of
hanozri
s
secret
friends
indignant
at
this
moneychanger
s
monstrous
betrayal
is
plotting
with
his
accomplices
to
kill
him
tonight
and
to
foist
the
money
paid
for
the
betrayal
on
the
high
priest
with
a
note
i
return
the
cursed
money
the
head
of
the
secret
service
cast
no
more
of
his
unexpected
glances
at
the
hegemon
but
went
on
listening
to
him
narrowing
his
eyes
as
pilate
went
on
imagine
is
it
going
to
be
pleasant
for
the
high
priest
to
receive
such
a
gift
on
the
night
of
the
feast
not
only
not
pleasant
the
guest
replied
smiling
but
i
believe
procurator
that
it
will
cause
a
very
great
scandal
i
am
of
the
same
opinion
myself
and
therefore
i
ask
you
to
occupy
yourself
with
this
matter
that
is
to
take
all
measures
to
protect
judas
of
kiriath
the
hegemon
s
order
will
be
carried
out
said
aphranius
but
i
must
reassure
the
hegemon
the
evildoers
plot
is
very
hard
to
bring
off
only
think
the
guest
looked
over
his
shoulder
as
he
spoke
and
went
on
to
track
the
man
down
to
kill
him
and
besides
that
to
find
out
how
much
he
got
and
manage
to
return
the
money
to
kaifa
and
all
that
in
one
night
tonight
and
none
the
less
he
will
be
killed
tonight
pilate
stubbornly
repeated
i
have
a
presentiment
i
tell
you
never
once
has
it
deceived
me
here
a
spasm
passed
over
the
procurator
s
face
and
he
rubbed
his
hands
briskly
understood
the
guest
obediently
replied
stood
up
straightened
out
and
suddenly
asked
sternly
so
they
will
kill
him
hegemon
yes
answered
pilate
and
all
hope
lies
in
your
efficiency
alone
which
amazes
everyone
the
guest
adjusted
the
heavy
belt
under
his
cloak
and
said
i
salute
you
and
wish
you
health
and
joy
ah
yes
pilate
exclaimed
softly
i
completely
forgot
i
owe
you
something
the
guest
was
amazed
really
procurator
you
owe
me
nothing
but
of
course
as
i
was
riding
into
yershalaim
remember
the
crowd
of
beggars
i
wanted
to
throw
them
some
money
but
i
didn
t
have
any
and
so
i
took
it
from
you
oh
procurator
it
was
a
trifle
one
ought
to
remember
trifles
too
here
pilate
turned
picked
up
the
cloak
that
lay
on
the
chair
behind
him
took
a
leather
bag
from
under
it
and
handed
it
to
the
guest
the
man
bowed
accepting
it
and
put
the
bag
under
his
cloak
i
expect
a
report
on
the
burial
said
pilate
and
also
on
the
matter
to
do
with
judas
of
kiriath
this
same
night
do
you
hear
aphranius
this
night
the
convoy
will
have
orders
to
awaken
me
the
moment
you
appear
i
ll
be
expecting
you
i
salute
you
the
head
of
the
secret
service
said
and
turning
left
the
balcony
one
could
hear
the
wet
sand
crunch
under
his
feet
then
the
stamp
of
his
boots
on
the
marble
between
the
lions
then
his
legs
were
cut
off
then
his
body
and
finally
the
hood
also
disappeared
only
here
did
theprocurator
notice
that
the
sun
was
gone
and
twilight
had
come
chapter
the
burial
and
perhaps
it
was
the
twilight
that
caused
such
a
sharp
change
in
the
procurator
s
appearance
he
aged
grew
hunched
as
if
before
one
s
eyes
and
besides
that
became
alarmed
once
he
looked
around
and
gave
a
start
for
some
reason
casting
an
eye
on
the
empty
chair
with
the
cloak
thrown
over
its
back
the
night
of
the
feast
was
approaching
the
evening
shadows
played
their
game
and
the
tired
procurator
probably
imagined
that
someone
was
sitting
in
the
empty
chair
yielding
to
his
faintheartedness
and
ruffling
the
cloak
the
procurator
let
it
drop
and
began
rushing
about
the
balcony
now
rubbing
his
hands
now
rushing
to
the
table
and
seizing
the
cup
now
stopping
and
staring
senselessly
at
the
mosaics
of
the
floor
as
if
trying
to
read
something
written
there
it
was
the
second
time
in
the
same
day
that
anguish
came
over
him
rubbing
his
temple
where
only
a
dull
slightly
aching
reminder
of
the
morning
s
infernal
pain
lingered
the
procurator
strained
to
understand
what
the
reason
for
his
soul
s
torments
was
and
he
quickly
understood
it
but
attempted
to
deceive
himself
it
was
clear
to
him
that
that
afternoon
he
had
lost
something
irretrievably
and
that
he
now
wanted
to
make
up
for
the
loss
by
some
petty
worthless
and
above
all
belated
actions
the
deceiving
of
himself
consisted
in
the
procurator
s
trying
to
convince
himself
that
these
actions
now
this
evening
were
no
less
important
than
the
morning
s
sentence
but
in
this
the
procurator
succeeded
very
poorly
at
one
of
his
turns
he
stopped
abruptly
and
whistled
in
response
to
this
whistle
a
low
barking
resounded
in
the
twilight
and
a
gigantic
sharpeared
dog
with
a
grey
pelt
and
a
goldstudded
collar
sprang
from
the
garden
on
to
the
balcony
banga
banga
the
procurator
cried
weakly
the
dog
rose
on
his
hind
legs
placed
his
front
paws
on
his
master
s
shoulders
nearly
knocking
him
to
the
floor
and
licked
his
cheek
the
procurator
sat
down
in
the
armchair
banga
his
tongue
hanging
out
panting
heavily
lay
down
at
his
master
s
feet
and
the
joy
in
the
dog
s
eyes
meant
that
the
storm
was
over
the
only
thing
in
the
world
that
the
fearless
dog
was
afraid
of
and
also
that
he
was
again
there
next
to
the
man
whom
he
loved
respected
and
considered
the
most
powerful
man
in
the
world
the
ruler
of
all
men
thanks
to
whom
the
dog
considered
himself
a
privileged
lofty
and
special
being
lying
down
at
his
master
s
feet
without
even
looking
at
him
but
looking
into
the
dusky
garden
the
dog
nevertheless
realized
at
once
that
trouble
had
befallen
his
master
he
therefore
changed
his
position
got
up
came
from
the
side
and
placed
his
front
paws
and
head
on
the
procurator
s
knees
smearing
the
bottom
of
his
cloak
with
wet
sandbanga
s
actions
were
probably
meant
to
signify
that
he
comforted
his
master
and
was
ready
to
meet
misfortune
with
him
he
also
attempted
to
express
this
with
his
eyes
casting
sidelong
glances
at
his
master
and
with
his
alert
prickedup
ears
thus
the
two
of
them
the
dog
and
man
who
loved
eachother
met
the
night
of
the
feast
on
the
balcony
just
then
the
procurator
s
guest
was
in
the
midst
of
a
great
bustle
after
leaving
the
upper
terrace
of
the
garden
before
the
balcony
he
went
down
the
stairs
to
the
next
terrace
of
the
garden
turned
right
and
came
to
the
barracks
which
stood
on
the
palace
grounds
in
these
barracks
the
two
centuries
that
had
come
withthe
procurator
for
the
feast
in
yershalaim
were
quartered
as
was
the
procurator
s
secret
guard
which
was
under
the
command
of
this
very
guest
the
guest
did
not
spend
much
time
in
the
barracks
no
more
than
ten
minutes
but
at
the
end
of
these
ten
minutes
three
carts
drove
out
of
the
barracks
yard
loaded
with
entrenching
tools
and
a
barrel
of
water
the
carts
were
escorted
by
fifteen
mounted
men
in
grey
cloaks
under
their
escort
the
carts
left
the
palace
grounds
by
the
rear
gate
turned
west
drove
through
gates
in
the
city
wall
and
followed
a
path
first
to
the
bethlehem
road
then
down
this
road
to
the
north
came
to
the
intersection
by
the
hebron
gate
and
then
moved
down
the
jaffa
road
along
which
the
procession
had
gone
during
the
day
with
the
men
condemned
to
death
by
that
time
it
was
already
dark
and
the
moon
appeared
on
the
horizon
soon
after
the
departure
of
the
carts
with
their
escorting
detachment
the
procurator
s
guest
also
left
the
palace
grounds
on
horseback
having
changed
into
a
dark
worn
chiton
the
guest
went
not
out
of
the
city
but
into
it
some
time
later
he
could
be
seen
approaching
the
antonia
fortress
located
to
the
north
and
in
the
vicinity
of
the
great
temple
the
guest
did
not
spend
much
time
in
the
fortress
either
and
then
his
tracks
turned
up
in
the
lower
city
in
its
crooked
and
tangled
streets
here
the
guest
now
came
riding
a
mule
knowing
the
city
well
the
guest
easily
found
the
street
he
wanted
it
was
called
greek
street
because
there
were
several
greek
shops
on
it
among
them
one
that
sold
carpets
precisely
by
this
shop
the
guest
stopped
his
mule
dismounted
and
tied
it
to
the
ring
by
the
gate
the
shop
was
closed
by
then
the
guest
walked
through
the
little
gate
beside
the
entrance
to
the
shop
and
found
himself
in
a
small
square
courtyard
surrounded
on
three
sides
by
sheds
turning
a
comer
inside
the
yard
the
guest
came
to
the
stone
terrace
of
a
house
all
twined
with
ivy
and
looked
around
both
the
little
house
and
the
sheds
were
dark
no
lamps
were
lit
yet
the
guest
called
softly
niza
at
this
call
a
door
creaked
and
in
the
evening
twilight
a
young
woman
without
a
veil
appeared
on
the
terrace
she
leaned
over
the
railing
peering
anxiously
wishing
to
know
who
had
come
recognizing
the
visitor
she
smiled
amiably
to
him
nodded
her
head
waved
her
hand
are
you
alone
aphranius
asked
softly
in
greek
yes
the
woman
on
the
terrace
whispered
my
husband
left
for
caesarea
in
the
morning
here
the
woman
looked
back
at
the
door
and
added
in
a
whisper
but
the
servingwoman
is
at
home
here
she
made
a
gesture
meaning
come
in
aphranius
looked
around
and
went
up
the
stone
steps
after
which
both
he
and
the
woman
disappeared
into
the
house
with
this
woman
aphranius
spent
very
little
time
certainly
no
more
than
five
minutes
after
which
he
left
the
house
and
the
terrace
pulled
the
hood
down
lower
on
his
eyes
and
went
out
to
the
street
just
then
the
lamps
were
being
lit
in
the
houses
the
prefestive
tumult
was
still
considerable
and
aphranius
on
his
mule
lost
himself
in
the
stream
of
riders
and
passersby
his
subsequent
route
is
not
known
to
anyone
the
woman
aphranius
called
niza
left
alone
began
changing
her
clothes
and
was
hurrying
greatly
but
difficult
though
it
was
for
her
to
find
the
things
she
needed
in
the
dark
room
she
did
not
light
a
lamp
or
call
the
servingwoman
only
after
she
was
ready
and
her
head
was
covered
by
a
dark
veil
did
the
sound
of
hervoice
break
the
silence
in
the
little
house
if
anyone
asks
for
me
say
i
went
to
visit
enanta
the
old
servingwoman
s
grumbling
was
heard
in
the
darkness
enanta
ah
this
enanta
didn
t
your
husband
forbid
you
to
visit
her
she
s
a
procuress
your
enanta
wait
till
i
tell
your
husband
well
well
be
quiet
niza
replied
and
like
a
shadow
slipped
out
of
the
house
niza
s
sandals
pattered
over
the
stone
flags
of
the
yard
the
servingwoman
grumbling
shut
the
door
to
the
terrace
niza
left
her
house
just
at
that
time
from
another
lane
in
the
lower
city
a
twisting
lane
that
ran
down
from
ledge
to
ledge
to
one
of
the
city
pools
from
the
gates
of
an
unsightly
house
with
a
blank
wall
looking
on
to
the
lane
and
windows
on
the
courtyard
came
a
young
man
with
a
neatly
trimmed
beard
wearing
a
white
kefia
falling
to
his
shoulders
a
new
pale
blue
festive
tallith
with
tassels
at
the
bottom
and
creaking
new
sandals
the
handsome
aquilinenosed
young
fellow
all
dressed
up
for
the
great
feast
walked
briskly
getting
ahead
of
passersby
hurrying
home
for
the
solemn
meal
and
watched
as
one
window
after
another
lit
up
the
young
man
took
the
street
leading
past
the
bazaar
to
the
palace
of
the
high
priest
kaifa
located
at
the
foot
of
the
temple
hill
some
time
later
he
could
be
seen
entering
the
gates
of
kaifa
s
courtyard
and
a
bit
later
still
leaving
the
same
courtyard
after
visiting
the
palace
where
the
lamps
and
torches
already
blazed
and
where
the
festive
bustle
had
already
begun
the
young
man
started
walking
still
more
briskly
still
more
joyfully
hastening
back
to
the
lower
city
at
the
comer
where
the
street
flowed
into
the
marketplace
amidst
the
seething
and
tumult
he
was
overtaken
by
a
slight
woman
walking
with
a
dancer
s
gait
in
a
black
veil
that
came
down
over
her
eyes
as
she
overtook
the
handsome
young
man
this
woman
raised
her
veil
for
a
moment
cast
a
glance
in
the
young
man
s
direction
yet
not
only
did
not
slow
her
pace
but
quickened
it
as
if
trying
to
escape
from
the
one
she
had
overtaken
the
young
man
not
only
noticed
this
woman
no
he
also
recognized
her
and
having
recognized
her
gave
a
start
halted
looking
perplexedly
into
her
back
and
at
once
set
out
after
her
almost
knocking
over
some
passerby
carrying
a
jug
the
young
man
caught
up
with
the
woman
and
breathing
heavily
with
agitation
called
out
to
her
niza
the
woman
turned
narrowed
her
eyes
her
face
showing
cold
vexation
and
replied
drily
in
greek
ah
it
s
you
judas
i
didn
t
recognize
you
at
once
that
s
good
though
with
us
if
someone
s
not
recognized
it
s
a
sign
he
ll
get
rich
so
agitated
that
his
heart
started
leaping
like
a
bird
under
a
black
cloth
judas
asked
in
a
faltering
whisper
for
fear
passersby
might
overhear
where
are
you
going
niza
and
what
do
you
want
to
know
that
for
replied
niza
slowing
her
pace
and
looking
haughtily
at
judas
then
some
sort
of
childish
intonations
began
to
sound
in
judas
s
voice
he
whispered
in
bewilderment
but
why
we
had
it
all
arranged
i
wanted
to
come
to
you
you
said
you
d
be
home
all
evening
ah
no
no
answered
niza
and
she
pouted
her
lower
lip
capriciously
which
made
it
seem
to
judas
that
her
face
the
most
beautiful
face
he
had
ever
seen
in
his
life
became
still
more
beautiful
i
was
bored
you
re
having
a
feast
and
what
am
i
supposed
to
do
sit
and
listen
to
you
sighing
on
the
terrace
and
be
afraid
on
top
of
it
that
the
servingwoman
will
tell
him
about
it
no
no
i
decided
to
go
out
of
town
and
listen
to
the
nightingales
how
out
of
town
the
bewildered
judas
asked
alone
of
course
alone
answered
niza
let
me
accompany
you
judas
asked
breathlessly
his
mind
clouded
he
forgot
everything
in
the
world
and
looked
with
imploring
eyes
into
the
blue
eyes
of
niza
which
now
seemed
black
niza
said
nothing
and
quickened
her
pace
why
are
you
silent
niza
judas
said
pitifully
adjusting
his
pace
to
hers
won
t
i
be
bored
with
you
niza
suddenly
asked
and
stopped
here
judas
s
thoughts
became
totally
confused
well
all
right
niza
finally
softened
come
along
but
where
where
wait
let
s
go
into
this
yard
and
arrange
it
otherwise
i
m
afraid
some
acquaintance
will
see
me
and
then
they
ll
tell
my
husband
i
was
out
with
my
lover
and
here
niza
and
judas
were
no
longer
in
the
bazaar
they
were
whispering
under
the
gateway
of
some
yard
go
to
the
olive
estate
niza
whispered
pulling
the
veil
over
her
eyes
and
turning
away
from
a
man
who
was
coming
through
the
gateway
with
a
bucket
to
gethsemane
beyond
the
kedron
understand
yes
yes
yes
i
ll
go
ahead
niza
continued
but
don
t
follow
on
my
heels
keep
separate
from
me
i
ll
go
ahead
when
you
cross
the
stream
you
know
where
the
grotto
is
i
know
i
know
go
up
past
the
olive
press
and
turn
to
the
grotto
i
ll
be
there
only
don
t
you
dare
come
after
me
at
once
be
patient
wait
here
and
with
these
words
niza
walked
out
the
gateway
as
though
she
had
never
spoken
with
judas
judas
stood
for
some
time
alone
trying
to
collect
his
scattering
thoughts
among
them
was
the
thought
of
how
he
was
going
to
explain
his
absence
from
the
festal
family
meal
judas
stood
thinking
up
some
lie
but
in
his
agitation
was
unable
to
think
through
or
prepare
anything
properly
and
slowly
walked
out
the
gateway
now
he
changed
his
route
he
was
no
longer
heading
towards
the
lower
city
but
turned
back
to
kaifa
s
palace
the
feast
had
already
entered
the
city
in
the
windows
around
judas
not
only
were
lights
shining
but
hymns
of
praise
were
heard
on
the
pavement
belated
passersby
urged
their
donkeys
on
whipping
them
up
shouting
at
them
judas
s
legs
carried
him
by
themselves
and
he
did
not
notice
how
the
terrible
mossy
antonia
towers
flew
past
him
he
did
not
hear
the
roar
of
trumpets
in
the
fortress
did
not
pay
attention
to
the
mounted
roman
patrol
and
its
torch
that
flooded
his
path
with
an
alarming
light
turning
after
he
passed
the
tower
judas
saw
that
in
the
terrible
height
above
the
temple
two
gigantic
fivebranched
candlesticks
blazed
but
even
these
judas
made
out
vaguely
it
seemed
to
him
that
ten
lamps
of
an
unprecedented
size
lit
up
over
yershalaim
competing
with
the
light
of
the
single
lamp
that
was
rising
ever
higher
over
yershalaim
the
moon
now
judas
could
not
be
bothered
with
anything
he
headed
for
the
gethsemane
gate
he
wanted
to
leave
the
city
quickly
at
times
it
seemed
to
him
that
before
him
among
the
backs
and
faces
of
passersby
the
dancing
little
figure
flashed
leading
him
after
her
but
this
was
an
illusion
judas
realized
that
niza
was
significantly
ahead
of
him
judas
rushed
past
the
moneychanging
shops
and
finally
got
to
the
gethsemane
gate
there
burning
with
impatience
he
was
still
forced
to
wait
camels
were
coming
into
the
city
and
after
them
rode
a
syrian
military
patrol
which
judas
cursed
mentally
but
all
things
come
to
an
end
the
impatient
judas
was
already
beyond
the
city
wall
to
the
left
of
him
judas
saw
a
small
cemetery
next
to
it
several
striped
pilgrims
tents
crossing
the
dusty
road
flooded
with
moonlight
judas
headed
for
the
stream
of
the
kedron
with
the
intention
of
wading
across
it
the
water
babbled
quietly
under
judas
s
feet
jumping
from
stone
to
stone
he
finally
came
out
on
the
gethsemane
bank
opposite
and
saw
with
great
joy
that
here
the
road
below
the
gardens
was
empty
the
halfruined
gates
of
the
olive
estate
could
already
be
seen
not
far
away
after
the
stuffy
city
judas
was
struck
by
the
stupefying
smell
of
the
spring
night
from
the
garden
a
wave
of
myrtle
and
acacia
from
the
gethsemane
glades
poured
over
the
fence
no
one
was
guarding
the
gateway
there
was
no
one
in
it
and
a
few
minutes
later
judas
was
already
running
under
the
mysterious
shade
of
the
enormous
spreading
olive
trees
the
road
went
uphill
judas
ascended
breathing
heavily
at
times
emerging
from
the
darkness
on
to
patterned
carpets
of
moonlight
which
reminded
him
of
the
carpets
he
had
seen
in
the
shop
of
niza
s
jealous
husband
a
short
time
later
there
flashed
at
judas
s
left
hand
in
a
clearing
an
alive
press
with
a
heavy
stone
wheel
and
a
pile
of
barrels
there
was
no
one
in
the
garden
work
had
ended
at
sunset
and
now
over
judas
choirs
of
nightingales
pealed
and
trilled
judas
s
goal
was
near
he
knew
that
on
his
right
in
the
darkness
he
would
presently
begin
to
hear
the
soft
whisper
of
water
falling
in
the
grotto
and
so
it
happened
he
heard
it
it
was
getting
cooler
then
he
slowed
his
pace
and
called
softly
niza
but
instead
of
niza
a
stocky
male
figure
detaching
itself
from
a
thick
olive
trunk
leaped
out
on
the
road
and
something
gleamed
in
its
hand
and
at
once
went
out
with
a
weak
cry
judas
rushed
back
but
a
second
man
barred
his
way
the
first
man
in
front
of
him
asked
judas
how
much
did
you
just
get
speak
if
you
want
to
save
your
life
hope
flared
up
in
judas
s
heart
and
he
cried
out
desperately
thirty
tetradrachmas
thirty
tetradrachmas
i
have
it
all
with
me
here
s
the
money
take
it
but
grant
me
my
life
the
man
in
front
instantly
snatched
the
purse
from
judas
s
hands
and
at
the
same
instant
a
knife
flew
up
behind
judas
s
back
and
struck
the
lover
under
the
shoulderblade
judas
was
flung
forward
and
thrust
out
his
hands
with
clawed
fingers
into
the
air
the
front
man
caught
judas
on
his
knife
and
buried
it
up
to
the
hilt
in
judas
s
heart
ni
za
judas
said
not
in
his
own
high
and
clear
young
voice
but
in
a
low
and
reproachful
one
and
uttered
not
another
sound
his
body
struck
the
earth
so
hard
that
it
hummed
then
a
third
figure
appeared
on
the
road
this
third
one
wore
a
cloak
with
a
hood
don
t
linger
he
ordered
the
killers
quickly
wrapped
the
purse
together
with
a
note
handed
to
them
by
the
third
man
in
a
piece
of
hide
and
crisscrossed
it
with
twine
the
second
put
the
bundle
into
his
bosom
and
then
the
two
killers
plunged
off
the
roadsides
and
the
darkness
between
the
olive
trees
ate
them
the
third
squatted
down
by
the
murdered
man
and
looked
at
his
face
in
the
darkness
it
appeared
white
as
chalk
to
the
gazing
man
and
somehow
spiritually
beautiful
a
few
seconds
later
there
was
not
a
living
man
on
the
road
the
lifeless
body
lay
with
outstretched
arms
the
left
foot
was
in
a
spot
of
moonlight
so
that
each
strap
of
the
sandal
could
be
seen
distinctly
the
whole
garden
of
gethsemane
was
just
then
pealing
with
the
song
of
nightingales
where
the
two
who
had
stabbed
judas
went
no
one
knows
but
the
route
of
the
third
man
in
the
hood
is
known
leaving
the
road
he
headed
into
the
thick
of
the
olive
trees
making
his
way
south
he
climbed
over
the
garden
fence
far
from
the
main
gate
in
the
southern
corner
where
the
upper
stones
of
the
masonry
had
fallen
out
soon
he
was
on
the
bank
of
the
kedron
then
he
entered
the
water
and
for
some
time
made
his
way
in
it
until
he
saw
ahead
the
silhouettes
of
two
horses
and
a
man
beside
them
the
horses
were
also
standing
in
the
stream
the
water
flowed
washing
their
hoofs
the
horsehandler
mounted
one
of
the
horses
the
man
in
the
hood
jumped
on
to
the
other
and
the
two
slowly
walked
in
the
stream
and
one
could
hear
the
pebbles
crunching
under
the
horses
hoofs
then
the
riders
left
the
water
came
out
on
the
yershalaim
bank
and
rode
slowly
under
the
city
wall
here
the
horsehandler
separated
himself
galloped
ahead
and
disappeared
from
view
while
the
man
in
the
hood
stopped
his
horse
dismounted
on
the
deserted
road
removed
his
cloak
turned
it
inside
out
took
from
under
the
cloak
a
flat
helmet
without
plumes
and
put
it
on
now
it
was
a
man
in
a
military
chlamys
with
a
short
sword
at
his
hip
who
jumped
on
to
the
horse
he
touched
the
reins
and
the
fiery
cavalry
horse
set
off
at
a
trot
jolting
its
rider
it
was
not
a
long
way
the
rider
was
approaching
the
southern
gate
of
yershalaim
under
the
arch
of
the
gateway
the
restless
flame
of
torches
danced
and
leaped
the
soldiers
on
guard
from
the
second
century
of
the
lightning
legion
sat
on
stone
benches
playing
dice
seeing
a
military
man
ride
in
the
soldiers
jumped
up
the
man
waved
his
hand
to
them
and
rode
on
into
the
city
the
city
was
flooded
with
festive
lights
the
flames
of
lamps
played
in
all
the
windows
and
from
everywhere
merging
into
one
dissonant
chorus
came
hymns
of
praise
occasionally
glancing
into
windows
that
looked
on
to
the
street
the
rider
could
see
people
at
tables
set
with
roast
kid
and
cups
of
wine
amidst
dishes
of
bitter
herbs
whistling
some
quiet
song
the
rider
made
his
way
at
an
unhurried
trot
through
the
deserted
streets
of
the
lower
city
heading
for
the
antonia
tower
glancing
occasionally
at
the
fivebranched
candlesticks
such
as
the
world
had
never
seen
blazing
above
the
temple
or
at
the
moon
that
hung
still
higher
than
the
fivebranched
candlesticks
the
palace
of
herod
the
great
took
no
part
in
the
solemnities
of
the
passover
night
in
the
auxiliary
quarters
of
the
palace
facing
to
the
south
where
the
officers
of
the
roman
cohort
and
the
legate
of
the
legion
were
stationed
lights
burned
and
there
was
a
feeling
of
some
movement
and
life
but
the
front
part
the
formal
part
which
housed
the
sole
and
involuntary
occupant
of
the
palace
the
procurator
all
of
it
with
its
columns
and
golden
statues
was
as
if
blind
under
the
brightest
moon
here
inside
the
palace
darkness
and
silence
reigned
and
the
procurator
as
he
had
told
aphranius
would
not
go
inside
he
ordered
his
bed
made
up
on
the
balcony
there
where
he
had
dined
and
where
he
had
conducted
the
interrogation
in
the
morning
the
procurator
lay
on
the
madeup
couch
but
sleep
would
not
come
to
him
the
bare
moon
hung
high
in
the
clear
sky
and
the
procurator
did
not
take
his
eyes
off
it
for
several
hours
approximately
at
midnight
sleep
finally
took
pity
on
the
hegemon
with
a
spasmodic
yawn
the
procurator
unfastened
and
threw
off
his
cloak
removed
the
belt
girded
over
his
shirt
with
a
broad
steel
knife
in
a
sheath
placed
it
on
the
chair
by
his
couch
took
off
his
sandals
and
stretched
out
banga
got
on
the
bed
at
once
and
lay
down
next
to
him
head
to
head
and
the
procurator
placing
his
hand
on
the
dog
s
neck
finally
closed
his
eyes
only
then
did
the
dog
also
fall
asleep
the
couch
was
in
semidarkness
shielded
from
the
moon
by
a
column
but
a
ribbon
of
moonlight
stretched
from
the
porch
steps
to
the
bed
and
once
the
procurator
lost
connection
with
what
surrounded
him
in
reality
he
immediately
set
out
on
the
shining
road
and
went
up
it
straight
towards
the
moon
he
even
burst
out
laughing
in
his
sleep
from
happiness
so
wonderful
and
inimitable
did
everything
come
to
be
on
the
transparent
pale
blue
road
he
walked
in
the
company
of
banga
and
beside
him
walked
the
wandering
philosopher
they
were
arguing
about
something
very
complex
and
important
and
neither
of
them
could
refute
the
other
they
did
not
agree
with
each
other
in
anything
and
that
made
their
argument
especially
interesting
and
endless
it
went
without
saying
that
today
s
execution
proved
to
be
a
sheer
misunderstanding
here
this
philosopher
who
had
thought
up
such
an
incredibly
absurd
thing
as
that
all
men
are
good
was
walking
beside
him
therefore
he
was
alive
and
of
course
it
would
be
terrible
even
to
think
that
one
could
execute
such
a
man
there
had
been
no
execution
no
execution
that
was
the
loveliness
of
this
journey
up
the
stairway
of
the
moon
there
was
as
much
free
time
as
they
needed
and
the
storm
would
come
only
towards
evening
and
cowardice
was
undoubtedly
one
of
the
most
terrible
vices
thus
spoke
yeshua
hanozri
no
philosopher
i
disagree
with
you
it
is
the
most
terrible
vice
he
for
example
the
present
procurator
of
judea
and
former
tribune
of
a
legion
had
been
no
coward
that
time
in
the
valley
of
the
virgins
when
the
fierce
germani
had
almost
torn
ratslayer
the
giant
to
pieces
but
good
heavens
philosopher
how
can
you
with
your
intelligence
allow
yourself
to
think
that
for
the
sake
of
a
man
who
has
committed
a
crime
against
caesar
the
procurator
of
judea
would
ruin
his
career
yes
yes
pilate
moaned
and
sobbed
in
his
sleep
of
course
he
would
in
the
morning
he
still
would
not
but
now
at
night
after
weighing
everything
he
would
agree
to
ruin
it
he
would
do
everything
to
save
the
decidedly
innocent
mad
dreamer
and
healer
from
execution
now
we
shall
always
be
together
said
the
ragged
wandering
philosopher
in
his
dream
who
for
some
unknown
reason
had
crossed
paths
with
the
equestrian
of
the
golden
spear
where
there
s
one
of
us
straight
away
there
will
be
the
other
whenever
i
am
remembered
you
will
at
once
be
remembered
too
i
the
foundling
the
son
of
unknown
parents
and
you
the
son
of
an
astrologerking
and
a
miller
s
daughter
the
beautiful
pila
yes
and
don
t
you
forget
to
remember
me
the
astrologer
s
son
pilate
asked
in
his
dream
and
securing
in
his
dream
a
nod
from
the
ensarid
beggar
who
was
walking
beside
him
the
cruel
procurator
of
judea
wept
and
laughed
from
joy
in
his
dream
this
was
all
very
good
but
the
more
terrible
was
the
hegemon
s
awakening
banga
growled
at
the
moon
and
the
paleblue
road
slippery
as
though
smoothed
with
oil
fell
away
before
the
procurator
he
opened
his
eyes
and
the
first
thing
he
remembered
was
that
the
execution
had
been
the
first
thing
the
procurator
did
was
to
clutch
banga
s
collar
with
a
habitual
gesture
then
with
sick
eyes
he
began
searching
for
the
moon
and
saw
that
it
had
moved
slightly
to
the
side
and
turned
silvery
its
light
was
being
interfered
with
by
an
unpleasant
restless
light
playing
on
the
balcony
right
before
his
eyes
a
torch
blazed
and
smoked
in
the
hand
of
the
centurion
ratslayer
the
holder
of
it
glanced
sidelong
with
fear
and
spite
at
the
dangerous
beast
preparing
itself
to
leap
stay
banga
the
procurator
said
in
a
sick
voice
and
coughed
shielding
himself
from
the
flame
with
his
hand
he
went
on
even
at
night
even
by
moonlight
i
have
no
peace
oh
gods
yours
is
also
a
bad
job
mark
you
cripple
soldiers
mark
gazed
at
the
procurator
in
great
amazement
and
the
man
recollected
himself
to
smooth
over
the
unwarranted
words
spoken
while
not
quite
awake
the
procurator
said
don
t
be
offended
centurion
my
position
i
repeat
is
still
worse
what
do
you
want
the
head
of
the
secret
guard
is
waiting
to
see
you
mark
reported
calmly
call
him
call
him
the
procurator
ordered
clearing
his
throat
with
a
cough
and
he
began
feeling
for
his
sandals
with
his
bare
feet
the
flame
played
on
the
columns
the
centurion
s
caligae
tramped
across
the
mosaics
the
centurion
went
out
to
the
garden
even
by
moonlight
i
have
no
peace
the
procurator
said
to
himself
grinding
his
teeth
instead
of
the
centurion
a
man
in
a
hood
appeared
on
the
balcony
stay
banga
the
procurator
said
quietly
and
pressed
the
back
of
the
dog
s
head
before
beginning
to
speak
aphranius
as
was
his
custom
looked
around
and
stepped
into
the
shadow
and
having
made
sure
that
besides
banga
there
were
no
extra
persons
on
the
balcony
he
said
quietly
i
ask
to
be
tried
procurator
you
turned
out
to
be
right
i
was
unable
to
protect
judas
of
kiriath
he
has
been
stabbed
to
death
i
ask
to
be
tried
and
retired
it
seemed
to
aphranius
that
four
eyes
were
looking
at
him
a
dog
s
and
a
wolf
s
aphranius
took
from
under
his
chlamys
a
purse
stiff
with
blood
sealed
with
two
seals
this
is
the
bag
of
money
the
killers
left
at
the
high
priest
s
house
the
blood
on
this
bag
is
the
blood
of
judas
of
kiriath
how
much
is
there
i
wonder
asked
pilate
bending
over
the
bag
thirty
tetradrachmas
the
procurator
grinned
and
said
not
much
aphranius
was
silent
where
is
the
murdered
man
that
i
do
not
know
the
visitor
who
never
parted
with
his
hood
said
with
calm
dignity
we
will
begin
a
search
in
the
morning
the
procurator
started
abandoning
a
sandal
strap
that
refused
to
be
fastened
but
you
do
know
for
certain
that
he
was
killed
to
this
the
procurator
received
a
dry
response
i
have
been
working
in
judea
for
fifteen
years
procurator
i
began
my
service
under
valerius
gratus
i
do
not
have
to
see
the
corpse
in
order
to
say
that
a
man
has
been
killed
and
so
i
report
to
you
that
the
one
who
was
called
judas
of
kiriath
was
stabbed
to
death
several
hours
ago
forgive
me
aphranius
answered
pilate
i
m
not
properly
awake
yet
that
s
why
i
said
it
i
sleep
badly
the
procurator
grinned
i
keep
seeing
a
moonbeam
in
my
sleep
quite
funny
imagine
it
s
as
if
i
m
walking
along
this
moonbeam
and
so
i
would
like
to
know
your
thoughts
on
this
matter
where
are
you
going
to
look
for
him
sit
down
head
of
the
secret
service
aphranius
bowed
moved
the
chair
closer
to
the
bed
and
sat
down
clanking
his
sword
i
am
going
to
look
for
him
not
far
from
the
oil
press
in
the
garden
of
gethsemane
so
so
and
why
there
precisely
as
i
figure
it
hegemon
judas
was
not
killed
in
yershalaim
itself
nor
anywhere
very
far
from
it
he
was
killed
near
yershalaim
i
regard
you
as
one
of
the
outstanding
experts
in
your
business
i
don
t
know
how
things
are
in
rome
but
in
the
colonies
you
have
no
equal
but
explain
to
me
why
are
you
going
to
look
for
him
precisely
there
i
will
by
no
means
admit
the
notion
aphranius
spoke
in
a
low
voice
of
judas
letting
himself
be
caught
by
any
suspicious
people
within
city
limits
it
s
impossible
to
put
a
knife
into
a
man
secretly
in
the
street
that
means
he
was
lured
to
a
basement
somewhere
but
the
service
has
already
searched
for
him
in
the
lower
city
and
undoubtedly
would
have
found
him
he
is
not
in
the
city
i
can
guarantee
that
if
he
was
killed
far
from
the
city
this
packet
of
money
could
not
have
been
dropped
off
so
quickly
he
was
killed
near
the
city
they
managed
to
lure
him
out
of
the
city
i
cannot
conceive
how
that
could
have
been
done
yes
procurator
that
is
the
most
difficult
question
in
the
whole
affair
and
i
don
t
even
know
if
i
will
succeed
in
resolving
it
it
is
indeed
mysterious
a
believer
on
the
eve
of
the
feast
goes
out
of
the
city
for
some
unknown
reason
leaving
the
passover
meal
and
perishes
there
who
could
have
lured
him
and
how
could
it
have
been
done
by
a
woman
the
procurator
asked
on
a
sudden
inspiration
aphranius
replied
calmly
and
weightily
by
no
means
procurator
that
possibility
is
utterly
excluded
one
must
reason
logically
who
was
interested
in
judas
s
death
some
wandering
dreamers
some
circle
in
which
first
of
all
there
weren
t
any
women
to
marry
procurator
one
needs
money
to
bring
a
person
into
the
world
one
needs
the
same
but
to
put
a
knife
into
a
man
with
the
help
of
a
woman
one
needs
very
big
money
and
no
vagabond
has
got
it
there
was
no
woman
in
this
affair
procurator
moreover
i
will
say
that
such
an
interpretation
of
the
murder
can
only
throw
us
off
the
track
hinder
the
investigation
and
confuse
me
ah
yes
i
forgot
to
ask
the
procurator
rubbed
his
forehead
how
did
they
manage
to
foist
the
money
on
kaifa
you
see
procurator
that
is
not
especially
complicated
the
avengers
came
from
behind
kaifa
s
palace
where
the
lane
is
higher
than
the
yard
they
threw
the
packet
over
the
fence
with
a
note
yes
exactly
as
you
suspected
procurator
i
see
that
you
are
perfectly
right
aphranius
said
pilate
and
i
merely
allowed
myself
to
express
a
supposition
alas
it
is
erroneous
procurator
but
what
is
it
then
what
is
it
exclaimed
the
procurator
peering
into
aphranius
s
face
with
greedy
curiosity
i
suppose
it
s
money
again
an
excellent
thought
but
who
could
have
offered
him
money
at
night
outside
the
city
and
for
what
oh
no
procurator
it
s
not
that
i
have
only
one
supposition
and
if
it
is
wrong
i
may
not
find
any
other
explanations
aphranius
leaned
closer
to
the
procurator
and
finished
in
a
whisper
judas
wanted
to
hide
his
money
in
a
secluded
place
known
only
to
himself
a
very
subtle
explanation
that
apparently
is
how
things
were
now
i
understand
you
he
was
lured
out
not
by
others
but
by
his
own
purpose
yes
yes
that
s
so
so
judas
was
mistrustful
he
was
hiding
the
money
from
others
yes
in
gethsemane
you
said
and
why
you
intend
to
look
for
him
precisely
there
that
i
confess
i
do
not
understand
oh
procurator
that
is
the
simplest
thing
of
all
no
one
would
hide
money
on
the
roads
in
open
and
empty
places
judas
was
neither
on
the
road
to
hebron
nor
on
the
road
to
bethany
he
had
to
be
in
a
protected
secluded
place
with
trees
it
s
as
simple
as
that
and
except
for
gethsemane
there
are
no
such
places
near
yershalaim
he
couldn
t
have
gone
far
you
have
utterly
convinced
me
and
so
what
are
we
to
do
now
i
will
immediately
start
a
search
for
the
murderers
who
tracked
judas
out
of
the
city
and
i
myself
meanwhile
as
i
have
already
reported
to
you
will
stand
trial
what
for
my
guards
lost
him
in
the
bazaar
last
evening
after
he
left
kaifa
s
palace
how
it
happened
i
cannot
comprehend
it
has
never
happened
before
in
my
life
he
was
put
under
surveillance
just
after
our
conversation
but
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
bazaar
he
doubled
back
somewhere
and
made
sucha
strange
loop
that
he
escaped
without
a
trace
so
i
declare
to
you
that
i
do
not
consider
it
necessary
to
try
you
you
did
all
you
could
and
no
one
in
the
world
here
the
procurator
smiled
could
do
more
than
you
penalize
the
sleuths
who
lost
judas
but
here
too
i
warn
you
i
would
not
want
it
to
be
anything
of
a
severe
sort
in
the
last
analysis
we
did
everything
to
take
care
of
the
blackguard
yes
although
here
aphranius
tore
the
seal
off
the
packet
and
showed
its
contents
to
pilate
good
heavens
what
are
you
doing
aphranius
those
must
be
temple
seals
the
procurator
needn
t
trouble
himself
with
that
question
aphranius
replied
closing
the
packet
can
it
be
that
you
have
all
the
seals
pilate
asked
laughing
it
couldn
t
be
otherwise
procurator
aphranius
replied
very
sternly
not
laughing
at
all
i
can
imagine
the
effect
at
kaifa
s
yes
procurator
it
caused
great
agitation
they
summoned
me
immediately
even
in
the
semidarkness
one
could
see
how
pilate
s
eyes
flashed
that
s
interesting
interesting
i
venture
to
disagree
procurator
it
was
not
interesting
a
most
boring
and
tiresome
business
to
my
question
whether
anyone
had
been
paid
money
in
kaifa
s
palace
i
was
told
categorically
that
there
had
been
nothing
of
the
sort
ah
yes
well
so
if
no
one
was
paid
no
one
was
paid
it
will
be
that
much
harder
to
find
the
killers
absolutely
right
procurator
it
suddenly
occurs
to
me
aphranius
might
he
not
have
killed
himself
oh
no
procurator
aphranius
replied
even
leaning
back
in
his
chair
from
astonishment
excuse
me
but
that
is
entirely
unlikely
ah
everything
is
likely
in
this
city
i
m
ready
to
bet
that
in
a
very
short
time
rumours
of
it
will
spread
all
over
the
city
here
aphranius
again
darted
his
look
at
the
procurator
thought
for
a
moment
and
replied
that
may
be
procurator
the
procurator
was
obviously
still
unable
to
part
with
this
question
of
the
killing
of
the
man
from
kiriath
though
everything
was
already
clear
and
he
said
even
with
a
sort
of
reverie
but
i
d
like
to
have
seen
how
they
killed
him
he
was
killed
with
great
art
procurator
aphranius
replied
glancing
somewhat
ironically
at
the
procurator
how
do
you
know
that
kindly
pay
attention
to
the
bag
procurator
aphranius
replied
i
guarantee
you
that
judas
s
blood
gushed
out
in
a
stream
i
ve
seen
murdered
people
in
my
time
procurator
so
of
course
he
won
t
rise
no
procurator
he
will
rise
replied
aphranius
smiling
philosophically
when
the
trumpet
of
the
messiah
they
re
expecting
here
sounds
over
him
but
before
then
he
won
t
rise
enough
aphranius
the
question
is
clear
let
s
go
on
to
the
burial
the
executed
men
have
been
buried
procurator
oh
aphranius
it
would
be
a
crime
to
try
you
you
re
deserving
of
the
highest
reward
how
was
it
aphranius
began
to
tell
about
it
while
he
himself
was
occupied
with
judas
s
affair
a
detachment
of
the
secret
guard
under
the
direction
of
his
assistant
arrived
at
the
hill
as
evening
came
one
of
the
bodies
was
not
found
on
the
hilltop
pilate
gave
a
start
and
said
hoarsely
ah
how
did
i
not
foresee
it
no
need
to
worry
procurator
said
aphranius
and
he
went
on
with
his
narrative
the
bodies
of
dysmas
and
gestas
their
eyes
pecked
out
by
carrion
birds
were
taken
up
and
they
immediately
rushed
in
search
of
the
third
body
it
was
discovered
in
a
very
short
time
a
certain
man
matthew
levi
said
pilate
not
questioningly
but
rather
affirmatively
yes
procurator
matthew
levi
was
hiding
in
a
cave
on
the
northern
slope
of
bald
skull
waiting
for
darkness
the
naked
body
of
yeshua
hanozri
was
with
him
when
the
guards
entered
the
cave
with
a
torch
levi
fell
into
despair
and
wrath
he
shouted
about
having
committed
no
crime
and
about
every
man
s
right
by
law
to
bury
an
executed
criminal
if
he
so
desires
matthew
levi
said
he
did
not
want
to
part
with
the
body
he
was
agitated
cried
out
something
incoherent
now
begging
now
threatening
and
cursing
did
they
have
to
arrest
him
pilate
asked
glumly
no
procurator
no
aphranius
replied
very
soothingly
they
managed
to
quiet
the
impudent
madman
explaining
to
him
that
the
body
would
be
buried
levi
having
grasped
what
was
being
said
to
him
calmed
down
but
announced
that
he
would
not
leave
and
wished
to
take
part
in
the
burial
he
said
he
would
not
leave
even
if
they
started
to
kill
him
and
even
offered
for
that
purpose
a
bread
knife
he
had
with
him
was
he
chased
away
pilate
asked
in
a
stifled
voice
no
procurator
no
my
assistant
allowed
him
to
take
part
in
the
burial
which
of
your
assistants
was
in
charge
of
it
asked
pilate
tolmai
aphranius
answered
and
added
in
alarm
perhaps
he
made
a
mistake
go
on
answered
pilate
there
was
no
mistake
generally
i
am
beginning
to
feel
a
bit
at
a
loss
aphranius
i
am
apparently
dealing
with
a
man
who
never
makes
mistakes
that
man
is
you
matthew
levi
was
taken
in
the
cart
with
the
bodies
of
the
executed
men
and
in
about
two
hours
they
reached
a
solitary
ravine
north
of
yershalaim
there
the
detachment
working
in
shifts
dug
a
deep
hole
within
an
hour
and
buried
all
three
executed
men
in
it
naked
no
procurator
the
detachment
brought
chitons
with
them
for
that
purpose
they
put
rings
on
the
buried
men
s
fingers
yeshua
s
with
one
notch
dysmas
s
with
two
and
gestas
s
with
three
the
hole
has
been
covered
over
and
heaped
with
stones
the
landmark
is
known
to
tolmai
ah
if
only
i
had
foreseen
it
pilate
spoke
wincing
i
needed
to
see
this
matthew
levi
he
is
here
procurator
pilate
his
eyes
wide
open
stared
at
aphranius
for
some
time
and
then
said
i
thank
you
for
everything
that
has
been
done
in
this
affair
i
ask
you
to
send
tolmai
to
me
tomorrow
and
to
tell
him
beforehand
that
i
am
pleased
with
him
and
you
aphranius
here
the
procurator
took
a
seal
ring
from
the
pouch
of
the
belt
lying
on
the
table
and
gave
it
to
the
head
of
the
secret
service
i
beg
you
to
accept
this
as
a
memento
aphranius
bowed
and
said
a
great
honour
procurator
i
request
that
the
detachment
that
performed
the
burial
be
given
rewards
the
sleuths
who
let
judas
slip
a
reprimand
have
matthew
levi
sent
to
me
right
now
i
must
have
the
details
on
yeshua
s
case
understood
procurator
aphranius
replied
and
began
retreating
and
bowing
while
the
procurator
clapped
his
hands
and
shouted
to
me
here
a
lamp
to
the
colonnade
aphranius
was
going
out
to
the
garden
when
lights
began
to
flash
in
the
hands
of
servants
behind
pilate
s
back
three
lamps
appeared
on
the
table
before
the
procurator
and
the
moonlit
night
at
once
retreated
to
the
garden
as
if
aphranius
had
led
it
away
with
him
in
place
of
aphranius
an
unknown
man
small
and
skinny
stepped
on
to
the
balcony
beside
the
gigantic
centurion
the
latter
catchingthe
procurator
s
eye
withdrew
to
the
garden
at
once
and
there
disappeared
the
procurator
studied
the
newcomer
with
greedy
and
slightly
frightened
eyes
so
one
looks
at
a
man
of
whom
one
has
heard
a
great
deal
of
whom
one
has
been
thinking
and
who
finally
appears
the
newcomer
a
man
of
about
forty
was
blackhaired
ragged
covered
with
caked
mud
and
looked
wolflike
from
under
his
knitted
brows
in
short
he
was
very
unsightly
and
rather
resembled
a
city
beggar
of
whom
there
were
many
hanging
about
on
the
porches
of
the
temple
or
in
the
bazaars
of
the
noisy
and
dirty
lower
city
the
silence
continued
for
a
long
time
and
was
broken
by
the
strange
behaviour
of
the
man
brought
to
pilate
his
countenance
changed
he
swayed
and
if
he
had
not
grasped
the
edge
of
the
table
with
his
dirty
hand
he
would
have
fallen
what
s
wrong
with
you
pilate
asked
him
nothing
answered
matthew
levi
and
he
made
a
movement
as
if
he
were
swallowing
something
his
skinny
bare
grey
neck
swelled
out
and
then
slackened
again
what
s
wrong
answer
me
pilate
repeated
i
m
tired
levi
answered
and
looked
sullenly
at
the
floor
sit
down
said
pilate
pointing
to
the
armchair
levi
looked
at
the
procurator
mistrustfully
moved
towards
the
armchair
gave
a
timorous
sidelong
glance
at
the
gilded
armrests
and
sat
down
not
in
the
chair
but
beside
it
on
the
floor
explain
to
me
why
did
you
not
sit
in
the
chair
asked
pilate
i
m
dirty
i
d
soil
it
said
levi
looking
at
the
ground
you
ll
presently
be
given
something
to
eat
i
don
t
want
to
eat
answered
levi
why
lie
pilate
asked
quietly
you
haven
t
eaten
for
the
whole
day
and
maybe
even
longer
very
well
don
t
eat
i
ve
summoned
you
so
that
you
could
show
me
the
knife
you
had
with
you
the
soldiers
took
it
from
me
when
they
brought
me
here
levi
replied
and
added
sullenly
you
must
give
it
back
to
me
i
have
to
return
it
to
its
owner
i
stole
it
what
for
to
cut
the
ropes
answered
levi
mark
cried
the
procurator
and
the
centurion
stepped
in
under
the
columns
give
me
his
knife
the
centurion
took
a
dirty
bread
knife
from
one
of
the
two
cases
on
his
belt
handed
it
to
the
procurator
and
withdrew
who
did
you
take
the
knife
from
from
the
bakery
by
the
hebron
gate
just
as
you
enter
the
city
on
the
left
pilate
looked
at
the
broad
blade
for
some
reason
tried
the
sharpness
of
the
edge
with
his
finger
and
said
concerning
the
knife
you
needn
t
worry
the
knife
will
be
returned
to
the
shop
but
now
i
want
a
second
thing
show
me
the
charta
you
carry
with
you
on
which
yeshua
s
words
are
written
down
levi
looked
at
pilate
with
hatred
and
smiled
such
an
inimical
smile
that
his
face
became
completely
ugly
you
want
to
take
away
the
last
thing
he
asked
i
didn
t
say
give
me
answered
pilate
i
said
show
me
levi
fumbled
in
his
bosom
and
produced
a
parchment
scroll
pilate
took
it
unrolled
it
spread
it
out
between
the
lights
and
squinting
began
to
study
the
barely
legible
ink
marks
it
was
difficult
to
understand
these
crabbed
lines
and
pilate
kept
wincing
and
leaning
right
to
the
parchment
running
his
finger
over
the
lines
he
did
manage
to
make
out
that
the
writing
represented
an
incoherent
chain
of
certain
utterances
certain
dates
household
records
and
poetic
fragments
some
of
it
pilate
could
read
there
is
no
death
yesterday
we
ate
sweet
spring
baccuroth
grimacing
with
the
effort
pilate
squinted
as
he
read
we
shall
see
the
pure
river
of
the
water
of
life
mankind
shall
look
at
the
sun
through
transparent
crystal
here
pilate
gave
a
start
in
the
last
lines
of
the
parchment
he
made
out
the
words
greater
vice
cowardice
pilate
rolled
up
the
parchment
and
with
an
abrupt
movement
handed
it
to
levi
take
it
he
said
and
after
a
pause
added
you
re
a
bookish
man
i
see
and
there
s
no
need
for
you
to
go
around
alone
in
beggar
s
clothing
without
shelter
i
have
a
big
library
in
caesarea
i
am
very
rich
and
want
to
take
you
to
work
for
me
you
will
sort
out
and
look
after
the
papyri
you
will
be
fed
and
clothed
levi
stood
up
and
replied
no
i
don
t
want
to
why
the
procurator
asked
his
face
darkening
am
i
disagreeable
to
you
are
you
afraid
of
me
the
same
bad
smile
distorted
levi
s
face
and
he
said
no
because
you
ll
be
afraid
of
me
it
won
t
be
very
easy
for
you
to
look
me
in
the
face
now
that
you
ve
killed
him
quiet
replied
pilate
take
some
money
levi
shook
his
head
negatively
and
the
procurator
went
on
i
know
you
consider
yourself
a
disciple
of
yeshua
but
i
can
tell
you
that
you
learned
nothing
of
what
he
taught
you
for
if
you
had
you
would
certainly
take
something
from
me
bear
in
mind
that
before
he
died
he
said
he
did
not
blame
anyone
pilate
raised
a
finger
significantly
pilate
s
face
was
twitching
and
he
himself
would
surely
have
taken
something
you
are
cruel
and
he
was
not
cruel
where
will
you
go
levi
suddenly
came
up
to
the
table
leaned
both
hands
on
it
and
gazing
at
the
procurator
with
burning
eyes
whispered
to
him
know
hegemon
that
i
am
going
to
kill
a
man
in
yershalaim
i
wanted
to
tell
you
that
so
you
d
know
there
will
be
more
blood
i
too
know
there
will
be
more
of
it
replied
pilate
you
haven
t
surprised
me
with
your
words
you
want
of
course
to
kill
me
you
i
won
t
manage
to
kill
replied
levi
baring
his
teeth
and
smiling
i
m
not
such
a
foolish
man
as
to
count
on
that
but
i
ll
kill
judas
of
kiriath
i
ll
devote
the
rest
of
my
life
to
it
here
pleasure
showed
in
the
procurator
s
eyes
and
beckoning
matthew
levi
to
come
closer
he
said
you
won
t

trouble
yourself
judas
has
already
been
killed
this
night
levi
sprang
away
from
the
table
looking
wildly
around
and
cried
out
who
did
it
don
t
be
jealous
pilate
answered
his
teeth
bared
and
rubbed
his
hands
i
m
afraid
he
had
other
admirers
besides
you
who
did
it
levi
repeated
in
a
whisper
pilate
answered
him
i
did
it
levi
opened
his
mouth
and
stared
at
the
procurator
who
said
quietly
it
is
of
course
not
much
to
have
done
but
all
the
same
i
did
it
and
he
added
well
and
now
will
you
take
something
levi
considered
relented
and
finally
said
have
them
give
me
a
piece
of
clean
parchment
an
hour
went
by
levi
was
not
in
the
palace
now
the
silence
of
the
dawn
was
broken
only
by
the
quiet
noise
of
the
sentries
footsteps
in
the
garden
the
moon
was
quickly
losing
its
colour
one
could
see
at
the
other
edge
of
the
sky
the
whitish
dot
of
the
morning
star
the
lamps
had
gone
out
long
long
ago
the
procurator
lay
on
the
couch
putting
his
hand
under
his
cheek
he
slept
and
breathed
soundlessly
beside
him
slept
banga
thus
was
the
dawn
of
the
fifteenth
day
of
nisan
met
by
the
fifth
procurator
of
judea
pontius
pilate
chapter
the
end
of
apartment
no
when
margarita
came
to
the
last
words
of
the
chapter
thus
was
the
dawn
of
the
fifteenth
day
of
nisan
met
by
the
fifth
procurator
of
judea
pontius
pilate
it
was
morning
sparrows
could
be
heard
in
the
branches
of
the
willows
and
lindens
in
the
little
garden
conducting
a
merry
excited
morning
conversation
margarita
got
up
from
the
armchair
stretched
and
only
then
felt
how
broken
her
body
was
and
how
much
she
wanted
to
sleep
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
margarita
s
soul
was
in
perfect
order
her
thoughts
were
not
scattered
she
was
quite
unshaken
by
having
spent
the
night
supernaturally
she
was
not
troubled
by
memories
of
having
been
at
satan
s
ball
or
that
by
some
miracle
the
master
had
been
returned
to
her
that
the
novel
had
risen
from
the
ashes
that
everything
was
back
in
place
in
the
basement
in
the
lane
from
which
the
snitcher
aloisy
mogarych
had
been
expelled
in
short
acquaintance
with
woland
had
caused
her
no
psychic
damage
everything
was
as
if
it
ought
to
have
been
so
she
went
to
the
next
room
convinced
herself
that
the
master
was
soundly
and
peacefully
asleep
turned
off
the
unnecessary
table
lamp
and
stretched
out
by
the
opposite
wall
on
a
little
couch
covered
with
an
old
torn
sheet
a
minute
later
she
was
asleep
and
that
morning
she
had
no
dreams
the
basement
rooms
were
silent
the
builder
s
whole
little
house
was
silent
and
it
was
quiet
in
the
solitary
lane
but
just
then
that
is
at
dawn
on
saturday
an
entire
floor
of
a
certain
moscow
institution
was
not
asleep
and
its
windows
looking
out
on
a
big
asphaltpaved
square
which
special
machines
driving
around
slowly
and
droning
were
cleaning
with
brushes
shone
with
their
full
brightness
cutting
through
the
light
of
the
rising
sun
the
whole
floor
was
occupied
with
the
investigation
of
the
woland
case
and
the
lights
had
burned
all
night
in
dozens
of
offices
essentially
speaking
the
matter
had
already
become
clear
on
the
previous
day
friday
when
the
variety
had
had
to
be
closed
owing
to
the
disappearance
of
its
administration
and
all
sorts
of
outrages
which
had
taken
place
during
the
notorious
seance
of
black
magic
the
day
before
but
the
thing
was
that
more
and
more
new
material
kept
arriving
all
the
time
and
incessantly
on
the
sleepless
floor
now
the
investigators
of
this
strange
case
which
smacked
of
obvious
devilry
with
an
admixture
of
some
hypnotic
tricks
and
distinct
criminality
had
to
shape
into
one
lump
all
the
manysided
and
tangled
events
that
had
taken
place
in
various
parts
of
moscow
the
first
to
visit
the
sleepless
electrically
litup
floor
was
arkady
apollonovich
sempleyarov
chairman
of
the
acoustics
commission
after
dinner
on
friday
in
his
apartment
located
in
a
house
by
the
kamenny
bridge
the
telephone
rang
and
a
male
voice
asked
for
arkady
apollonovich
arkady
apollonovich
s
wife
who
picked
up
the
phone
replied
sullenly
that
arkady
apollonovich
was
unwell
had
retired
for
the
night
and
could
not
come
to
the
phone
however
arkady
apollonovich
came
to
the
phone
all
the
same
to
the
question
of
where
arkady
apollonovich
was
being
called
from
the
voice
in
the
telephone
had
said
very
briefly
where
it
was
from
this
second
at
once
this
minute
babbled
the
ordinarily
very
haughty
wife
of
the
chairman
of
the
acoustics
commission
and
she
flew
to
the
bedroom
like
an
arrow
to
rouse
arkady
apollonovich
from
his
bed
where
he
lay
experiencing
the
torments
of
hell
at
the
recollection
of
yesterday
s
seance
and
the
night
s
scandal
followed
by
the
expulsion
of
his
saratov
niece
from
the
apartment
not
in
a
second
true
yet
not
in
a
minute
either
but
in
a
quarter
of
a
minute
arkady
apollonovich
with
one
slipper
on
his
left
foot
in
nothing
but
his
underwear
was
already
at
the
phone
babbling
into
it
yes
it
s
me
i
m
listening
i
m
listening
his
wife
forgetting
for
these
moments
all
the
loathsome
crimes
against
fidelity
in
which
the
unfortunate
arkady
apollonovich
had
been
exposed
kept
sticking
herself
out
the
door
to
the
corridor
with
a
frightened
face
poking
a
slipper
at
the
air
and
whispering
put
the
slipper
on
the
slipper
you
ll
catch
cold
at
which
arkady
apollonovich
waving
his
wife
away
with
his
bare
foot
and
making
savage
eyes
at
her
muttered
into
the
telephone
yes
yes
yes
surely
i
understand
i
ll
leave
at
once
arkady
apollonovich
spent
the
whole
evening
on
that
same
floor
where
the
investigation
was
being
conducted
it
was
a
difficult
conversation
a
most
unpleasant
conversation
for
he
had
to
tell
with
complete
sincerity
not
only
about
this
obnoxious
seance
and
the
fight
in
the
box
but
along
with
that
as
was
indeed
necessary
also
about
militsa
andreevna
pokobatko
from
yelokhovskaya
street
and
about
the
saratov
niece
and
about
much
else
the
telling
of
which
caused
arkady
apollonovich
inexpressible
torments
needless
to
say
the
testimony
of
arkady
apollonovich
an
intelligent
and
cultivated
man
who
had
been
a
witness
to
the
outrageous
seance
a
sensible
and
qualified
witness
who
gave
an
excellent
description
of
the
mysterious
masked
magician
himself
and
of
his
two
scoundrelly
assistants
a
witness
who
remembered
perfectly
well
that
the
magician
s
name
was
indeed
woland
advanced
the
investigation
considerably
and
the
juxtaposition
of
arkady
apollonovich
s
testimony
with
the
testimony
of
others
among
whom
were
some
ladies
who
had
suffered
after
the
seance
the
one
in
violet
underwear
who
had
shocked
rimsky
and
alas
many
others
and
the
messenger
karpov
who
had
been
sent
to
apartment
no
on
sadovaya
street
at
once
essentially
established
the
place
where
the
culprit
in
all
these
adventures
was
to
be
sought
apartment
no
was
visited
and
not
just
once
and
not
only
was
it
looked
over
with
extreme
thoroughness
but
the
walls
were
also
tapped
and
the
fireplace
flues
checked
in
search
of
hiding
places
however
none
of
these
measures
yielded
any
results
and
no
one
was
discovered
in
the
apartment
during
any
of
these
visits
though
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
there
was
someone
in
the
apartment
despite
the
fact
that
all
persons
who
in
one
way
or
another
were
supposed
to
be
in
charge
of
foreign
artistes
coming
to
moscow
decidedly
and
categorically
insisted
that
there
was
not
and
could
not
be
any
black
magician
woland
in
moscow
he
had
decidedly
not
registered
anywhere
on
arrival
had
not
shown
anyone
his
passport
or
other
papers
contracts
or
agreements
and
no
one
had
heard
anything
about
him
kitaitsev
head
of
the
programme
department
of
the
spectacles
commission
swore
to
god
that
the
vanished
styopa
likhodeev
had
never
sent
him
any
performance
programme
of
any
woland
for
approval
and
had
never
telephoned
him
about
the
arrival
of
such
a
woland
so
that
he
kitaitsev
utterly
failed
to
see
and
understand
how
styopa
could
have
allowed
such
a
seance
in
the
variety
and
when
told
that
arkady
apollonovich
had
seen
this
magician
at
the
seance
with
his
own
eyes
kitaitsev
only
spread
his
arms
and
raised
his
eyes
to
heaven
and
from
kitaitsev
s
eyes
alone
one
could
see
and
say
confidently
that
he
was
as
pure
as
crystal
that
same
prokhor
petrovich
chairman
of
the
main
spectacles
commission
incidentally
he
returned
to
his
suit
immediately
after
the
police
came
into
his
office
to
the
ecstatic
joy
of
anna
richardovna
and
the
great
perplexity
of
the
needlessly
troubled
police
also
incidentally
having
returned
to
his
place
into
his
grey
striped
suit
prokhor
petrovich
fully
approved
of
all
the
resolutions
the
suit
had
written
during
his
shortterm
absence
so
then
this
same
prokhor
petrovich
knew
decidedly
nothing
about
any
woland
whether
you
will
or
no
something
preposterous
was
coming
out
thousands
of
spectators
the
whole
staff
of
the
variety
and
finally
sempleyarov
arkady
apollonovich
a
most
educated
man
had
seen
this
magician
as
well
as
his
thricecursed
assistants
and
yet
it
was
absolutely
impossible
to
find
him
anywhere
what
was
it
may
i
ask
had
he
fallen
through
the
ground
right
after
his
disgusting
seance
or
as
some
affirm
had
he
not
come
to
moscow
at
all
but
if
the
first
is
allowed
then
undoubtedly
in
falling
through
he
had
taken
along
the
entire
top
administration
of
the
variety
and
if
the
second
then
would
it
not
mean
that
the
administration
of
the
luckless
theatre
itself
after
first
committing
some
vileness
only
recall
the
broken
window
in
the
study
and
the
behaviour
of
ace
of
diamonds
had
disappeared
from
moscow
without
a
trace
we
must
do
justice
to
the
one
who
headed
the
investigation
the
vanished
rimsky
was
found
with
amazing
speed
one
had
only
to
put
together
the
behaviour
of
ace
of
diamonds
at
the
cab
stand
by
the
movie
theatre
with
certain
given
times
such
as
when
the
seance
ended
and
precisely
when
rimsky
could
have
disappeared
and
then
immediately
send
a
telegram
to
leningrad
an
hour
later
towards
evening
on
friday
came
the
reply
that
rimsky
had
been
discovered
in
number
fourtwelve
on
the
fourth
floor
of
the
hotel
astoria
next
to
the
room
in
which
the
repertory
manager
of
one
of
the
moscow
theatres
then
on
tour
in
leningrad
was
staying
that
same
room
which
as
is
known
had
gilded
greyblue
furniture
and
a
wonderful
bathroom
discovered
hiding
in
the
wardrobe
of
number
fourtwelve
of
the
astoria
rimsky
was
questioned
right
there
in
leningrad
after
which
a
telegram
came
to
moscow
reporting
that
findirector
rimsky
was
in
an
unanswerable
state
that
he
could
not
or
did
not
wish
to
give
sensible
replies
to
questions
and
begged
only
to
be
hidden
in
a
bulletproof
room
and
provided
with
an
armed
guard
a
telegram
from
moscow
ordered
that
rimsky
be
delivered
to
moscow
under
guard
as
a
result
of
which
rimsky
departed
friday
evening
under
said
guard
on
the
evening
train
towards
evening
on
that
same
friday
likhodeev
s
trail
was
also
found
telegrams
of
inquiry
about
likhodeev
were
sent
to
all
cities
and
from
yalta
came
the
reply
that
likhodeev
had
been
in
yalta
but
had
left
on
a
plane
for
moscow
the
only
one
whose
trail
they
failed
to
pick
up
was
varenukha
the
famous
theatre
administrator
known
to
decidedly
all
of
moscow
had
vanished
into
thin
air
in
the
meantime
there
was
some
bother
with
things
happening
in
other
parts
of
moscow
outside
the
variety
theatre
it
was
necessary
to
explain
the
extraordinary
case
of
the
staff
all
singing
glorious
sea
incidentally
professor
stravinsky
managed
to
put
them
right
within
two
hours
by
means
of
some
subcutaneous
injections
of
persons
presenting
other
persons
or
institutions
with
devil
knows
what
in
the
guise
of
money
and
also
of
persons
who
had
suffered
from
such
presentations
as
goes
without
saying
the
most
unpleasant
the
most
scandalous
and
insoluble
of
all
these
cases
was
the
case
of
the
theft
of
the
head
of
the
deceased
writer
berlioz
right
from
the
coffin
in
the
hall
of
griboedov
s
carried
out
in
broad
daylight
twelve
men
conducted
the
investigation
gathering
as
on
a
knittingneedle
the
accursed
stitches
of
this
complicated
case
scattered
all
over
moscow
one
of
the
investigators
arrived
at
professor
stravinsky
s
clinic
and
first
of
all
asked
to
be
shown
a
list
of
the
persons
who
had
checked
in
to
the
clinic
over
the
past
three
days
thus
they
discovered
nikanor
ivanovich
bosoy
and
the
unfortunate
master
of
ceremonies
whose
head
had
been
torn
off
however
little
attention
was
paid
to
them
by
now
it
was
easy
to
establish
that
these
two
had
fallen
victim
to
the
same
gang
headed
by
that
mysterious
magician
but
to
ivan
nikolaevich
homeless
the
investigator
paid
great
attention
the
door
of
ivanushka
s
room
no
opened
towards
evening
on
friday
and
into
the
room
came
a
young
roundfaced
calm
and
mildmannered
man
who
looked
quite
unlike
an
investigator
and
yet
was
one
of
the
best
in
moscow
he
saw
lying
on
the
bed
a
pale
and
pinched
young
man
in
whose
eyes
one
could
read
a
lack
of
interest
in
what
went
on
around
him
whose
eyes
looked
now
somewhere
into
the
distance
over
his
surroundings
now
into
the
young
man
himself
the
investigator
gently
introduced
himself
and
said
he
had
stopped
at
ivan
nikolaevich
s
to
talk
over
the
events
at
the
patriarch
s
ponds
two
days
ago
oh
how
triumphant
ivan
would
have
been
if
the
investigator
had
come
to
him
earlier
say
on
wednesday
night
when
ivan
had
striven
so
violently
and
passionately
to
make
his
story
about
the
patriarch
s
ponds
heard
now
his
dream
of
helping
to
catch
the
consultant
had
come
true
there
was
no
longer
any
need
to
run
after
anyone
they
had
come
to
him
on
their
own
precisely
to
hear
his
story
about
what
had
happened
on
wednesday
evening
but
alas
ivanushka
had
changed
completely
in
the
time
that
had
passed
since
the
moment
of
berlioz
s
death
he
was
ready
to
answer
all
of
the
investigator
s
questions
willingly
and
politely
but
indifference
could
be
sensed
both
in
ivan
s
eyes
and
in
his
intonation
the
poet
was
no
longer
concerned
with
berlioz
s
fate
before
the
investigator
s
arrival
ivanushka
lay
dozing
and
certain
visions
passed
before
him
thus
he
saw
a
city
strange
incomprehensible
nonexistent
with
marble
masses
eroded
colonnades
roofs
gleaming
in
the
sun
with
the
black
gloomy
and
merciless
antonia
tower
with
the
palace
on
the
western
hill
sunk
almost
up
to
its
rooftops
in
the
tropical
greenery
of
the
garden
with
bronze
statues
blazing
in
the
sunset
above
this
greenery
and
he
saw
armourclad
roman
centuries
moving
along
under
the
walls
of
the
ancient
city
as
he
dozed
there
appeared
before
ivan
a
man
motionless
in
an
armchair
cleanshaven
with
a
harried
yellow
face
a
man
in
a
white
mantle
with
red
lining
gazing
hatefully
into
the
luxurious
and
alien
garden
ivan
also
saw
a
treeless
yellow
hill
with
empty
crossbarred
posts
and
what
had
happened
at
the
patriarch
s
ponds
no
longer
interested
the
poet
ivan
homeless
tell
me
ivan
nikolaevich
how
far
were
you
from
the
turnstile
yourself
when
berlioz
slipped
under
the
tramcar
a
barely
noticeable
indifferent
smile
touched
ivan
s
lips
for
some
reason
and
he
replied
i
was
far
away
and
the
checkered
one
was
right
by
the
turnstile
no
he
was
sitting
on
a
little
bench
nearby
you
clearly
recall
that
he
did
not
go
up
to
the
turnstile
at
the
moment
when
berlioz
fell
i
recall
he
didn
t
go
up
to
it
he
sat
sprawled
on
the
bench
these
questions
were
the
investigator
s
last
after
them
he
got
up
gave
ivanushka
his
hand
wished
him
a
speedy
recovery
and
expressed
the
hope
that
he
would
soon
be
reading
his
poetry
again
no
ivan
quietly
replied
i
won
t
write
any
more
poetry
the
investigator
smiled
politely
allowed
himself
to
express
his
certainty
that
while
the
poet
was
presently
in
a
state
of
some
depression
it
would
soon
pass
no
ivan
responded
looking
not
at
the
investigator
but
into
the
distance
at
the
fading
sky
it
will
never
pass
the
poems
i
used
to
write
were
bad
poems
and
now
i
understand
it
the
investigator
left
ivanushka
having
obtained
some
quite
important
material
following
the
thread
of
events
from
the
end
to
the
beginning
they
finally
succeeded
in
reaching
the
source
from
which
all
the
events
had
come
the
investigator
had
no
doubt
that
these
events
began
with
the
murder
at
the
patriarch
s
ponds
of
course
neither
ivanushka
nor
this
checkered
one
had
pushed
the
unfortunate
chairman
of
massolit
under
the
tramcar
physically
so
to
speak
no
one
had
contributed
to
his
falling
under
the
wheels
but
the
investigator
was
convinced
that
berlioz
had
thrown
himself
under
the
tramcar
or
tumbled
under
it
while
hypnotized
yes
there
was
already
a
lot
of
material
and
it
was
known
who
had
to
be
caught
and
where
but
the
thing
was
that
it
proved
in
no
way
possible
to
catch
anyone
we
must
repeat
there
undoubtedly
was
someone
in
the
thricecursed
apartment
no
occasionally
the
apartment
answered
telephone
calls
now
in
a
rattling
now
in
a
nasal
voice
occasionally
one
of
its
windows
was
opened
what
s
more
the
sounds
of
a
gramophone
came
from
it
and
yet
each
time
it
was
visited
decidedly
no
one
was
found
there
and
it
had
already
been
visited
more
than
once
and
at
different
times
of
day
and
not
only
that
but
they
had
gone
through
it
with
a
net
checking
every
comer
the
apartment
had
long
been
under
suspicion
guards
were
placed
not
just
at
the
way
to
the
courtyard
through
the
gates
but
at
the
back
entrance
as
well
not
only
that
but
guards
were
placed
on
the
roof
by
the
chimneys
yes
apartment
no
was
acting
up
and
it
was
impossible
to
do
anything
about
it
so
the
thing
dragged
on
until
midnight
on
friday
when
baron
meigel
dressed
in
evening
clothes
and
patentleather
shoes
solemnly
proceeded
into
apartment
no
in
the
quality
of
a
guest
one
could
hear
the
baron
being
let
in
to
the
apartment
exactly
ten
minutes
later
without
any
ringing
of
bells
the
apartment
was
visited
yet
not
only
were
the
hosts
not
found
in
it
but
which
was
something
quite
bizarre
no
signs
of
baron
meigel
were
found
in
it
either
and
so
as
was
said
the
thing
dragged
on
in
this
fashion
until
dawn
on
saturday
here
new
and
very
interesting
data
were
added
a
sixplace
passenger
plane
coming
from
the
crimea
landed
at
the
moscow
airport
among
the
other
passengers
one
strange
passenger
got
out
of
it
this
was
a
young
citizen
wildly
overgrown
with
stubble
unwashed
for
three
days
with
inflamed
and
frightened
eyes
carrying
no
luggage
and
dressed
somewhat
whimsically
the
citizen
was
wearing
a
tall
sheepskin
hat
a
georgian
felt
cape
over
a
nightshirt
and
new
justpurchased
blue
leather
bedroom
slippers
as
soon
as
he
separated
from
the
ladder
by
which
they
descended
from
the
plane
he
was
approached
this
citizen
had
been
expected
and
in
a
little
while
the
unforgettable
director
of
the
variety
stepan
bogdanovich
likhodeev
was
standing
before
the
investigators
he
threw
in
some
new
data
it
now
became
clear
that
woland
had
penetrated
the
variety
in
the
guise
of
an
artiste
having
hypnotized
styopa
likhodeev
and
had
then
contrived
to
fling
this
same
styopa
out
of
moscow
and
god
knows
how
many
miles
away
the
material
was
thus
augmented
yet
that
did
not
make
things
easier
but
perhaps
even
a
bit
harder
because
it
was
becoming
obvious
that
to
lay
hold
of
a
person
who
could
perform
such
stunts
as
the
one
of
which
stepan
bogdanovich
had
been
the
victim
would
not
be
so
easy
incidentally
likhodeev
at
his
own
request
was
confined
in
a
secure
cell
and
next
before
the
investigators
stood
varenukha
just
arrested
in
his
own
apartment
to
which
he
had
returned
after
a
blank
disappearance
of
almost
two
days
despite
the
promise
he
had
given
azazello
not
to
lie
any
more
the
administrator
began
precisely
with
a
lie
though
by
the
way
he
cannot
be
judged
very
harshly
for
it
azazello
had
forbidden
him
to
lie
and
be
rude
on
the
telephone
but
in
the
present
case
the
administrator
spoke
without
the
assistance
of
this
apparatus
his
eyes
wandering
ivan
savelyevich
declared
that
on
thursday
afternoon
he
had
got
drunk
in
his
office
at
the
variety
all
by
himself
after
which
he
went
somewhere
but
where
he
did
not
remember
drank
starka
somewhere
but
where
he
did
not
remember
lay
about
somewhere
under
a
fence
but
where
he
again
did
not
remember
only
after
the
administrator
was
told
that
with
his
behaviour
stupid
and
senseless
he
was
hindering
the
investigation
of
an
important
case
and
would
of
course
have
to
answer
for
it
did
varenukha
burst
into
sobs
and
whisper
in
a
trembling
voice
looking
around
him
that
he
had
lied
solely
out
of
fear
apprehensive
of
the
revenge
of
woland
s
gang
into
whose
hands
he
had
already
fallen
and
that
he
begged
implored
and
yearned
to
be
locked
up
in
a
bulletproof
cell
pah
the
devil
really
them
and
their
bulletproof
cells
grumbled
one
of
the
investigators
they
ve
been
badly
frightened
by
those
scoundrels
said
the
investigator
who
had
visited
ivanushka
they
calmed
varenukha
down
the
best
they
could
said
they
would
protect
him
without
any
cell
and
here
it
was
learned
that
he
had
not
drunk
any
starka
under
a
fence
and
that
he
had
been
beaten
by
two
one
redhaired
and
with
a
fang
the
other
fat
ah
resembling
a
cat
yes
yes
yes
whispered
the
administrator
sinking
with
fear
and
looking
around
him
every
second
coming
out
with
further
details
of
how
he
had
existed
for
some
two
days
in
apartment
no
in
the
quality
of
a
tipoff
vampire
who
had
all
but
caused
the
death
of
the
findirector
rimsky
just
then
rimsky
brought
on
the
leningrad
train
was
being
led
in
however
this
mentally
disturbed
greyhaired
old
man
trembling
with
fear
in
whom
it
was
very
difficult
to
recognize
the
former
findirector
would
not
tell
the
truth
for
anything
and
proved
to
be
very
stubborn
in
this
respect
rimsky
insisted
that
he
had
not
seen
any
hella
in
his
office
window
at
night
nor
any
varenukha
but
had
simply
felt
bad
and
in
a
state
of
unconsciousness
had
left
for
leningrad
needless
to
say
the
ailing
findirector
concluded
his
testimony
with
a
request
that
he
be
confined
to
a
bulletproof
cell
annushka
was
arrested
just
as
she
made
an
attempt
to
hand
a
tendollar
bill
to
the
cashier
of
a
department
store
on
the
arbat
annushka
s
story
about
people
flying
out
the
window
of
the
house
on
sadovaya
and
about
the
little
horseshoe
which
annushka
in
her
own
words
had
picked
up
in
order
to
present
it
to
the
police
was
listened
to
attentively
the
horseshoe
was
really
made
of
gold
and
diamonds
annushka
was
asked
as
if
i
don
t
know
diamonds
replied
annushka
but
he
gave
you
tenrouble
bills
you
say
as
if
i
don
t
know
tenrouble
bills
replied
annushka
well
and
when
did
they
turn
into
dollars
i
don
t
know
anything
about
any
dollars
i
never
saw
any
dollars
annushka
replied
shrilly
i
m
in
my
rights
i
got
recompensed
i
was
buying
cloth
with
it
and
she
went
off
into
some
balderdash
about
not
being
answerable
for
the
house
management
that
allowed
unclean
powers
on
to
the
fifth
floor
making
life
unbearable
here
the
investigator
waved
at
annushka
with
his
pen
because
everyone
was
properly
sick
of
her
and
wrote
a
pass
for
her
to
get
out
on
a
green
slip
of
paper
after
which
to
everyone
s
pleasure
annushka
disappeared
from
the
building
then
there
followed
one
after
another
a
whole
series
of
people
nikolai
ivanovich
among
them
just
arrested
owing
solely
to
the
foolishness
of
his
jealous
wife
who
towards
morning
had
informed
the
police
that
her
husband
had
vanished
nikolai
ivanovich
did
not
surprise
the
investigators
very
much
when
he
laid
on
the
table
the
clownish
certificate
of
his
having
spent
the
time
at
satan
s
ball
in
his
stories
of
how
he
had
carried
margarita
nikolaevna
s
naked
housekeeper
on
his
back
through
the
air
somewhere
to
hell
and
beyond
for
a
swim
in
a
river
and
of
the
preceding
appearance
of
the
bare
margarita
nikolaevna
in
the
window
nikolai
ivanovich
departed
somewhat
from
the
truth
thus
for
instance
he
did
not
consider
it
necessary
to
mention
that
he
had
arrived
in
the
bedroom
with
the
discarded
shift
in
his
hands
or
that
he
had
called
natasha
venus
from
his
words
it
looked
as
if
natasha
had
flown
out
the
window
got
astride
him
and
dragged
him
away
from
moscow
obedient
to
constraint
i
was
compelled
to
submit
nikolai
ivanovich
said
and
finished
his
tale
with
a
request
that
not
a
word
of
it
be
told
to
his
wife
which
was
promised
him
the
testimony
of
nikolai
ivanovich
provided
an
opportunity
for
establishing
that
margarita
nikolaevna
as
well
as
her
housekeeper
natasha
had
vanished
without
a
trace
measures
were
taken
to
find
them
thus
every
second
of
saturday
morning
was
marked
by
the
unrelenting
investigation
in
the
city
during
that
time
completely
impossible
rumours
emerged
and
floated
about
in
which
a
tiny
portion
of
truth
was
embellished
with
the
most
luxuriant
lies
it
was
said
that
there
had
been
a
seance
at
the
variety
after
which
all
two
thousand
spectators
ran
out
to
the
street
in
their
birthday
suits
that
a
press
for
making
counterfeit
money
of
a
magic
sort
had
been
nabbed
on
sadovaya
street
that
some
gang
had
kidnapped
five
managers
from
the
entertainment
sector
but
the
police
had
immediately
found
them
all
and
many
other
things
that
one
does
not
even
wish
to
repeat
meanwhile
it
was
getting
on
towards
dinner
time
and
then
in
the
place
where
the
investigation
was
being
conducted
the
telephone
rang
from
sadovaya
came
a
report
that
the
accursed
apartment
was
again
showing
signs
of
life
it
was
said
that
its
windows
had
been
opened
from
inside
that
sounds
of
a
piano
and
singing
were
coming
from
it
and
that
a
black
cat
had
been
seen
in
a
window
sitting
on
the
sill
and
basking
in
the
sun
at
around
four
o
clock
on
that
hot
day
a
big
company
of
men
in
civilian
clothes
got
out
of
three
cars
a
short
distance
from
no
bis
on
sadovaya
street
here
the
big
group
divided
into
two
small
ones
the
first
going
under
the
gateway
of
the
house
and
across
the
courtyard
directly
to
the
sixth
entrance
while
the
second
opened
the
normally
boardedup
little
door
leading
to
the
back
entrance
and
both
started
up
separate
stairways
to
apartment
no
just
then
koroviev
and
azazello
koroviev
in
his
usual
outfit
and
not
the
festive
tailcoat
were
sitting
in
the
dining
room
of
the
apartment
finishing
breakfast
woland
as
was
his
wont
was
in
the
bedroom
and
where
the
cat
was
nobody
knew
but
judging
by
the
clatter
of
dishes
coming
from
the
kitchen
it
could
be
supposed
that
behemoth
was
precisely
there
playing
the
fool
as
was
his
wont
and
what
are
those
footsteps
on
the
stairs
asked
koroviev
toying
with
the
little
spoon
in
his
cup
of
black
coffee
that
s
them
coming
to
arrest
us
azazello
replied
and
drank
off
a
glass
of
cognac
ahh
well
well
koroviev
replied
to
that
the
ones
going
up
the
front
stairway
were
already
on
the
thirdfloor
landing
there
a
couple
of
plumbers
were
pottering
over
the
harmonica
of
the
steam
heating
the
newcomers
exchanged
significant
glances
with
the
plumbers
they
re
all
at
home
whispered
one
of
the
plumbers
tapping
a
pipe
with
his
hammer
then
the
one
walking
at
the
head
openly
took
a
black
mauser
from
under
his
coat
and
another
beside
him
took
out
the
skeleton
keys
generally
those
going
to
apartment
no
were
properly
equipped
two
of
them
had
fine
easily
unfolded
silk
nets
in
their
pockets
another
of
them
had
a
lasso
another
had
gauze
masks
and
ampoules
of
chloroform
in
a
second
the
front
door
to
apartment
no
was
open
and
all
the
visitors
were
in
the
front
hall
while
the
slamming
of
the
door
in
the
kitchen
at
the
same
moment
indicated
the
timely
arrival
of
the
second
group
from
the
back
stairs
this
time
there
was
if
not
complete
at
least
some
sort
of
success
the
men
instantly
dispersed
through
all
the
rooms
and
found
no
one
anywhere
but
instead
on
the
table
of
the
dining
room
they
discovered
the
remains
of
an
apparently
justabandoned
breakfast
and
in
the
living
room
on
the
mantelpiece
beside
a
crystal
pitcher
sat
an
enormous
black
cat
he
was
holding
a
primus
in
his
paws
those
who
entered
the
living
room
contemplated
this
cat
for
quite
a
long
time
in
total
silence
hm
yes
that
s
quite
something
one
of
the
men
whispered
ain
t
misbehaving
ain
t
bothering
anybody
just
reparating
my
primus
said
the
cat
with
an
unfriendly
scowl
and
i
also
consider
it
my
duty
to
warn
you
that
the
cat
is
an
ancient
and
inviolable
animal
exceptionally
neat
job
whispered
one
of
the
men
and
another
said
loudly
and
distinctly
well
come
right
in
you
inviolable
ventriloquous
cat
the
net
unfolded
and
soared
upwards
but
the
man
who
cast
it
to
everyone
s
utter
astonishment
missed
and
only
caught
the
pitcher
which
straight
away
smashed
ringingly
you
lose
bawled
the
cat
hurrah
and
here
setting
the
primus
aside
he
snatched
a
browning
from
behind
his
back
in
a
trice
he
aimed
it
at
the
man
standing
closest
but
before
the
cat
had
time
to
shoot
fire
blazed
in
the
man
s
hand
and
at
the
blast
of
the
mauser
the
cat
plopped
head
first
from
the
mantelpiece
on
to
the
floor
dropping
the
browning
and
letting
go
of
the
primus
it
s
all
over
the
cat
said
in
a
weak
voice
sprawled
languidly
in
a
pool
of
blood
step
back
from
me
for
a
second
let
me
say
farewell
to
the
earth
oh
my
friend
azazello
moaned
the
cat
bleeding
profusely
where
are
you
the
cat
rolled
his
fading
eyes
in
the
direction
of
thediningroom
door
you
did
not
come
to
my
aid
in
the
moment
of
unequal
battle
you
abandoned
poor
behemoth
exchanging
him
for
a
glass
of
admittedly
very
good
cognac
well
so
let
my
death
be
on
your
conscience
and
i
bequeath
you
my
browning
the
net
the
net
the
net
was
anxiously
whispered
around
the
cat
but
the
net
devil
knows
why
got
caught
in
someone
s
pocket
and
refused
to
come
out
the
only
thing
that
can
save
a
mortally
wounded
cat
said
the
cat
is
a
swig
of
benzene
and
taking
advantage
of
the
confusion
he
bent
to
the
round
opening
in
the
primus
and
had
a
good
drink
of
benzene
the
blood
at
once
stopped
flowing
from
under
his
left
front
leg
the
cat
jumped
upalive
and
cheerful
seized
the
primus
under
his
paw
shot
back
on
to
the
mantelpiece
with
it
and
from
there
shredding
the
wallpaper
climbed
the
wall
and
some
two
seconds
later
was
high
above
the
visitors
and
sitting
on
a
metal
curtain
rod
hands
instantly
clutched
the
curtain
and
tore
it
off
together
with
the
rod
causing
sunlight
to
flood
the
shaded
room
but
neither
the
fraudulently
recovered
cat
nor
the
primus
fell
down
the
cat
without
parting
with
his
primus
managed
to
shoot
through
the
air
and
land
on
the
chandelier
hanging
in
the
middle
of
the
room
a
stepladder
came
from
below
i
challenge
you
to
a
duel
bawled
the
cat
sailing
over
their
heads
on
the
swinging
chandelier
and
the
browning
was
again
in
his
paw
and
the
primus
was
lodged
among
the
branches
of
the
chandelier
the
cat
took
aim
and
flying
like
a
pendulum
over
the
heads
of
the
visitors
opened
fire
on
them
the
din
shook
the
apartment
crystal
shivers
poured
down
from
the
chandelier
the
mantelpiece
mirror
was
cracked
into
stars
plaster
dust
flew
spent
cartridges
bounced
over
the
floor
windowpanes
shattered
benzene
spouted
from
the
bulletpierced
primus
now
there
was
no
question
of
taking
thecat
alive
and
the
visitors
fiercely
and
accurately
returned
his
fire
from
the
mausers
aiming
at
his
head
stomach
chest
and
back
the
shooting
caused
panic
on
the
asphalt
courtyard
but
this
shooting
did
not
last
long
and
began
to
die
down
of
itself
the
thing
was
that
it
caused
no
harm
either
to
the
cat
or
to
the
visitors
not
only
was
no
one
killed
but
no
one
was
even
wounded
everyone
including
the
cat
remained
totally
unharmed
one
of
the
visitors
to
verify
it
definitively
sent
some
five
bullets
at
the
confounded
animal
s
head
while
the
cat
smartly
responded
with
a
full
clip
but
it
was
the
same
no
effect
was
produced
on
anybody
the
cat
swayed
on
the
chandelier
which
swung
less
and
less
blowing
into
the
muzzle
of
his
browning
and
spitting
on
his
paw
for
some
reason
the
faces
of
those
standing
silently
below
acquired
an
expression
of
utter
bewilderment
this
was
the
only
case
or
one
of
the
only
cases
when
shooting
proved
to
be
entirely
inefficacious
one
might
allow
of
course
that
the
cat
s
browning
was
some
sort
of
toy
but
one
could
by
no
means
say
the
same
of
the
visitors
mausers
the
cat
s
very
first
wound
there
obviously
could
not
be
the
slightest
doubt
of
it
was
nothing
but
a
trick
and
a
swinish
sham
as
was
the
drinking
of
the
benzene
one
more
attempt
was
made
to
get
hold
of
the
cat
the
lasso
was
thrown
it
caught
on
one
of
the
candles
the
chandelier
fell
down
the
crash
seemed
to
shake
the
whole
structure
of
the
house
but
it
was
no
use
those
present
were
showered
with
splinters
and
the
cat
flew
through
the
air
over
them
and
settled
high
under
the
ceiling
on
the
upper
part
of
the
mantelpiece
mirror
s
gilded
frame
he
had
no
intention
of
escaping
anywhere
but
on
the
contrary
while
sitting
in
relative
safety
even
started
another
speech
i
utterly
fail
to
comprehend
he
held
forth
from
on
high
the
reasons
for
such
harsh
treatment
of
me
and
here
at
its
very
beginning
this
speech
was
interrupted
by
a
heavy
low
voice
coming
from
no
one
knew
where
what
s
going
on
in
the
apartment
they
prevent
me
from
working
another
voice
unpleasant
and
nasal
responded
well
it
s
behemoth
of
course
devil
take
him
a
third
rattling
voice
said
messire
it
s
saturday
the
sun
is
setting
time
to
go
excuse
me
i
can
t
talk
any
more
the
cat
said
from
the
mirror
time
to
go
he
hurled
his
browning
and
knocked
out
both
panes
in
the
window
then
he
splashed
down
some
benzene
and
this
benzene
caught
fire
by
itself
throwing
a
wave
of
flame
up
to
the
very
ceiling
things
caught
fire
somehow
unusually
quickly
and
violently
as
does
not
happen
even
with
benzene
the
wallpaper
at
once
began
to
smoke
the
torndown
curtain
started
burning
on
the
floor
and
the
frames
of
the
broken
windows
began
to
smoulder
the
cat
crouched
miaowed
shot
from
the
mirror
to
the
windowsill
and
disappeared
through
it
together
with
his
primus
shots
rang
out
outside
a
man
sitting
on
the
iron
fireescape
at
the
level
of
the
jeweller
s
wife
s
windows
fired
at
the
cat
as
he
flew
from
one
windowsill
to
another
making
for
the
corner
drainpipe
of
the
house
which
as
has
been
said
was
built
in
the
form
of
a
u
by
way
of
this
pipe
the
cat
climbed
up
to
the
roof
there
unfortunately
also
without
any
result
he
was
shotat
by
the
sentries
guarding
the
chimneys
and
the
cat
cleared
off
into
the
setting
sun
that
was
flooding
the
city
just
then
in
the
apartment
the
parquet
blazed
up
under
the
visitors
feet
and
in
that
fire
on
the
same
spot
where
the
cat
had
sprawled
with
his
sham
wound
there
appeared
growing
more
and
more
dense
the
corpse
of
the
former
baron
meigel
with
upthrust
chin
and
glassy
eyes
to
get
him
out
was
no
longer
possible
leaping
over
the
burning
squares
of
parquet
slapping
themselves
on
their
smoking
chests
and
shoulders
those
who
were
in
the
living
room
retreated
to
the
study
and
front
hall
those
who
were
in
the
dining
room
and
bedroom
ran
out
through
the
corridor
those
in
the
kitchen
also
came
running
and
rushed
into
the
front
hall
the
living
room
was
already
filled
with
fire
and
smoke
someone
managed
in
flight
to
dial
the
number
of
the
fire
department
and
shout
briefly
into
the
receiver
sadovaya
threeohtwobis
to
stay
longer
was
impossible
flames
gushed
out
into
the
front
hall
breathing
became
difficult
as
soon
as
the
first
little
spurts
of
smoke
pushed
through
the
broken
windows
of
the
enchanted
apartment
desperate
human
cries
arose
in
the
courtyard
fire
fire
we
re
burning
in
various
apartments
of
the
house
people
began
shouting
into
telephones
sadovaya
sadovaya
threeohtwobis
just
then
as
the
heartquailing
bells
were
heard
on
sadovaya
ringing
from
long
red
engines
racing
quickly
from
all
parts
of
the
city
the
people
rushing
about
the
yard
saw
how
along
with
the
smoke
there
flew
out
of
the
fifthstorey
window
three
dark
apparently
male
silhouettes
and
one
silhouette
of
a
naked
woman
chapter
the
last
adventures
of
koroviev
and
behemoth
whether
these
silhouettes
were
there
or
were
only
imagined
by
the
fearstruck
tenants
of
the
illfated
house
on
sadovaya
is
of
course
impossible
to
say
precisely
if
they
were
there
where
they
set
out
for
is
also
known
to
no
one
nor
can
wesay
where
they
separated
but
we
do
know
that
approximately
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
the
fire
started
on
sadovaya
there
appeared
by
the
mirrored
doors
of
a
currency
store
on
the
smolensky
marketplace
a
long
citizen
in
a
checkered
suit
and
with
him
a
big
black
cat
deftly
slithering
between
the
passersby
the
citizen
opened
the
outer
door
of
the
shop
but
here
a
small
bony
and
extremely
illdisposed
doorman
barred
his
way
and
said
irritably
no
cats
allowed
i
beg
your
pardon
rattled
the
long
one
putting
his
gnarled
hand
to
his
ear
as
if
he
were
hard
of
hearing
no
cats
you
say
and
where
do
you
see
any
cats
the
doorman
goggled
his
eyes
and
well
he
might
there
was
no
cat
at
the
citizen
s
feet
now
but
instead
from
behind
his
shoulder
a
fat
fellow
in
a
tattered
cap
whose
mug
indeed
somewhat
resembled
a
cat
s
stuck
out
straining
to
get
into
the
store
there
was
a
primus
in
the
fat
fellow
s
hands
the
misanthropic
doorman
for
some
reason
disliked
this
pair
of
customers
we
only
accept
currency
he
croaked
gazing
vexedly
from
under
his
shaggy
as
if
motheaten
grizzled
eyebrows
my
dear
man
rattled
the
long
one
flashing
his
eye
through
the
broken
pincenez
how
do
you
know
i
don
t
have
any
are
you
judging
by
my
clothes
never
do
so
my
most
precious
custodian
you
may
make
a
mistake
and
a
big
one
at
that
at
least
read
the
story
of
the
famous
caliph
harun
alrashid
over
again
but
in
the
present
case
casting
that
story
aside
temporarily
i
want
to
tell
you
that
i
am
going
to
make
a
complaint
about
you
to
the
manager
and
tell
him
such
tales
about
you
that
you
may
have
to
surrender
your
post
between
the
shining
mirrored
doors
maybe
i
ve
got
a
whole
primus
full
of
currency
the
catlike
fat
fellow
who
was
simply
shoving
his
way
into
the
store
vehemently
butted
into
the
conversation
behind
them
the
public
was
already
pushing
and
getting
angry
looking
at
the
prodigious
pair
with
hatred
and
suspicion
the
doorman
stepped
aside
and
our
acquaintances
koroviev
and
behemoth
found
themselves
in
the
store
here
they
first
of
all
looked
around
and
then
in
a
ringing
voice
heard
decidedly
in
every
comer
koroviev
announced
a
wonderful
store
a
very
very
fine
store
the
public
turned
away
from
the
counters
and
for
some
reason
looked
at
the
speaker
in
amazement
though
he
had
all
grounds
for
praising
the
store
hundreds
of
bolts
of
cotton
in
the
richest
assortment
of
colours
could
be
seen
in
the
pigeonholes
of
the
shelves
next
to
them
were
piled
calicoes
and
chiffons
and
flannels
for
suits
in
receding
perspective
endless
stacks
of
shoeboxes
could
be
seen
and
several
citizenesses
sat
on
little
low
chairs
one
foot
shod
in
an
old
wornout
shoe
the
other
in
a
shiny
new
pump
which
they
stamped
on
the
carpet
with
a
preoccupied
air
somewhere
in
the
depths
around
a
comer
gramophones
sang
and
played
music
but
bypassing
all
these
enchantments
koroviev
and
behemoth
made
straight
for
the
junction
of
the
grocery
and
confectionery
departments
here
there
was
plenty
of
room
no
citizenesses
in
scarves
and
little
berets
were
pushing
against
the
counters
as
in
the
fabric
department
a
short
perfectly
square
man
with
blue
shaven
jowls
hornrimmed
glasses
a
brandnew
hat
not
crumpled
and
with
no
sweat
stains
on
the
band
in
a
lilac
coat
and
orange
kid
gloves
stood
by
the
counter
grunting
something
peremptorily
a
sales
clerk
in
a
clean
white
smock
and
a
blue
hat
was
waiting
on
the
lilac
client
with
the
sharpest
of
knives
much
like
the
knife
stolen
by
matthew
levi
he
was
removing
from
a
weeping
plump
pink
salmon
its
snakelike
silvery
skin
this
department
is
splendid
too
koroviev
solemnly
acknowledged
and
the
foreigner
is
a
likeable
fellow
he
benevolently
pointed
his
finger
at
the
lilac
back
no
fagott
no
behemoth
replied
pensively
you
re
mistaken
my
friend
the
lilac
gentleman
s
face
lacks
something
in
my
opinion
the
lilac
back
twitched
but
probably
by
chance
for
the
foreigner
was
surely
unable
to
understand
what
koroviev
and
his
companion
were
saying
in
russian
is
good
the
lilac
purchaser
asked
sternly
topnotch
replied
the
sales
clerk
cockily
slipping
the
edge
of
the
knife
under
the
skin
good
i
like
bad
i
don
t
the
foreigner
said
sternly
right
you
are
the
sales
clerk
rapturously
replied
here
our
acquaintances
walked
away
from
the
foreigner
and
his
salmon
to
the
end
of
the
confectionery
counter
it
s
hot
today
koroviev
addressed
a
young
redcheeked
salesgirl
and
received
no
reply
to
his
words
how
much
are
the
mandarins
koroviev
then
inquired
of
her
fifteen
kopecks
a
pound
replied
the
salesgirl
everything
s
so
pricey
koroviev
observed
with
a
sigh
hm
hm
he
thought
a
little
longer
and
then
invited
his
companion
eat
up
behemoth
the
fat
fellow
put
his
primus
under
his
arm
laid
hold
of
the
top
mandarin
on
the
pyramid
straight
away
gobbled
it
up
skin
and
all
and
began
on
a
second
the
salesgirl
was
overcome
with
mortal
terror
you
re
out
of
your
mind
she
shouted
losing
her
colour
give
me
the
receipt
the
receipt
and
she
dropped
the
confectionery
tongs
my
darling
my
dearest
my
beauty
koroviev
rasped
leaning
over
the
counter
and
winking
at
the
salesgirl
we
re
out
of
currency
today
what
can
we
do
but
i
swear
to
you
by
next
time
and
no
later
than
monday
we
ll
pay
it
all
in
pure
cash
we
re
from
near
by
on
sadovaya
wherethey
re
having
the
fire
behemoth
after
swallowing
a
third
mandarin
put
his
paw
into
a
clever
construction
of
chocolate
bars
pulled
out
the
bottom
one
which
of
course
made
the
whole
thing
collapse
and
swallowed
it
together
with
its
gold
wrapper
the
sales
clerks
behind
the
fish
counter
stood
as
if
petrified
their
knives
in
their
hands
the
lilac
foreigner
swung
around
to
the
robbers
and
here
it
turned
out
that
behemoth
was
mistaken
there
was
nothing
lacking
in
the
lilac
one
s
face
but
on
the
contrary
rather
some
superfluity
of
hanging
jowls
and
furtive
eyes
turning
completely
yellow
the
salesgirl
anxiously
cried
for
the
whole
store
to
hear
palosich
palosich
the
public
from
the
fabric
department
came
thronging
at
this
cry
while
behemoth
stepping
away
from
the
confectionery
temptations
thrust
his
paw
into
a
barrel
labelled
choice
kerch
herring
pulled
out
a
couple
of
herring
and
swallowed
them
spitting
out
the
tails
palosich
the
desperate
cry
came
again
from
behind
the
confectionery
counter
and
from
behind
the
fish
counter
a
sales
clerk
with
a
goatee
barked
what
s
this
you
re
up
to
vermin
pavel
yosifovich
was
already
hastening
to
the
scene
of
the
action
he
was
an
imposing
man
in
a
clean
white
smock
like
a
surgeon
with
a
pencil
sticking
out
of
the
pocket
pavel
yosifovich
was
obviously
an
experienced
man
seeing
the
tail
of
the
third
herring
in
behemoth
s
mouth
he
instantly
assessed
the
situation
understood
decidedly
everything
and
without
getting
into
any
arguments
with
the
insolent
louts
waved
his
arm
into
the
distance
commanding
whistle
the
doorman
flew
from
the
mirrored
door
out
to
the
comer
of
the
smolensky
marketplace
and
dissolved
in
a
sinister
whistling
the
public
began
to
surround
the
blackguards
and
then
koroviev
stepped
into
the
affair
citizens
he
called
out
in
a
high
vibrating
voice
what
s
going
on
here
eh
allow
me
to
ask
you
that
the
poor
man
koroviev
let
some
tremor
into
his
voice
and
pointed
to
behemoth
who
immediately
concocted
a
woeful
physiognomy
the
poor
man
spends
all
day
reparating
primuses
he
got
hungry
and
where
s
he
going
to
get
currency
to
this
pavel
yosifovich
usually
restrained
and
calm
shouted
sternly
you
just
stop
that
and
waved
into
the
distance
impatiently
now
then
the
trills
by
the
door
resounded
more
merrily
but
koroviev
unabashed
by
pavel
yosifovich
s
pronouncement
went
on
where
i
ask
you
all
this
question
he
s
languishing
with
hunger
and
thirst
he
s
hot
so
the
hapless
fellow
took
and
sampled
a
mandarin
and
the
total
worth
of
that
mandarin
is
three
kopecks
and
here
they
go
whistling
like
spring
nightingales
in
the
woods
bothering
the
police
tearingthem
away
from
their
business
but
he
s
allowed
eh
and
here
koroviev
pointed
to
the
lilac
fat
man
which
caused
the
strongest
alarm
to
appear
on
his
face
who
is
he
eh
where
did
he
come
from
and
why
couldn
t
we
do
without
him
did
we
invite
him
or
what
of
course
the
exchoirmaster
bawled
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
twisting
his
mouth
sarcastically
just
look
at
him
in
his
smart
lilac
suit
all
swollen
with
salmon
all
stuffed
with
currency
and
us
what
about
the
likes
of
us
i
m
bitter
bitter
bitter
koroviev
wailed
like
the
best
man
at
an
oldfashioned
wedding
this
whole
stupid
tactless
and
probably
politically
harmful
speech
made
pavel
yosifovich
shake
with
wrath
but
strange
as
it
may
seem
one
could
see
by
the
eyes
of
the
crowding
public
that
it
provoked
sympathy
in
a
great
many
people
and
when
behemoth
putting
a
torn
dirty
sleeve
to
his
eyes
exclaimed
tragically
thank
you
my
faithful
friend
you
stood
up
for
the
sufferer
a
miracle
occurred
a
most
decent
quiet
little
old
man
poorly
but
cleanly
dressed
a
little
old
man
buying
three
macaroons
in
the
confectionery
department
was
suddenly
transformed
his
eyes
flashed
with
bellicose
fire
he
turned
purple
hurled
the
little
bag
of
macaroons
on
the
floor
and
shouted
true
in
a
child
s
high
voice
then
he
snatched
up
a
tray
throwing
from
it
the
remains
of
the
chocolate
eiffel
tower
demolished
by
behemoth
brandished
it
tore
the
foreigner
s
hat
off
with
his
left
hand
and
with
hisright
swung
and
struck
the
foreigner
flat
on
his
bald
head
with
the
tray
there
was
a
roll
as
of
the
noise
one
hears
when
sheets
of
metal
are
thrown
down
from
a
truck
the
fat
man
turning
white
fell
backwards
and
sat
in
the
barrel
of
kerch
herring
spouting
a
fountain
of
brine
from
it
straight
away
a
second
miracle
occurred
the
lilac
one
having
fallen
into
the
barrel
shouted
in
pure
russian
with
no
trace
of
any
accent
murder
police
the
bandits
are
murdering
me
evidently
having
mastered
owing
to
the
shock
this
language
hitherto
unknown
to
him
then
the
doorman
s
whistling
ceased
and
amid
the
crowds
of
agitated
shoppers
two
military
helmets
could
be
glimpsed
approaching
but
the
perfidious
behemoth
doused
the
confectionery
counter
with
benzene
from
his
primus
as
one
douses
a
bench
in
a
bathhouse
with
a
tub
of
water
and
it
blazed
up
of
itself
the
flame
spurted
upwards
and
ran
along
the
counter
devouring
the
beautiful
paper
ribbons
on
the
fruit
baskets
the
salesgirls
dashed
shrieking
from
behind
the
counters
and
as
soon
as
they
came
from
behind
them
the
linen
curtains
on
the
windows
blazed
up
and
the
benzene
on
the
floor
ignited
the
public
at
once
raising
a
desperate
cry
shrank
back
from
the
confectionery
department
running
down
the
no
longer
needed
pavel
yosifovich
and
from
behind
the
fish
counter
the
sales
clerks
with
their
whetted
knives
trotted
in
single
file
towards
the
door
of
the
rear
exit
the
lilac
citizen
having
extracted
himself
from
the
barrel
thoroughly
drenched
with
herring
juice
heaved
himself
over
the
salmon
on
the
counter
and
followed
after
them
the
glass
of
the
mirrored
front
doors
clattered
and
spilled
down
pushed
out
by
fleeing
people
while
the
two
blackguards
koroviev
and
the
glutton
behemoth
got
lost
somewhere
but
where
it
was
impossible
to
grasp
only
afterwards
did
eyewitnesses
who
had
been
present
at
the
starting
of
the
fire
in
the
currency
store
in
smolensky
marketplace
tell
how
the
two
hooligans
supposedly
flew
up
to
the
ceiling
and
there
popped
like
children
s
balloons
it
is
doubtful
of
course
that
things
happened
that
way
but
what
we
don
t
know
we
don
t
know
but
we
do
know
that
exactly
one
minute
after
the
happening
in
smolensky
marketplace
behemoth
and
koroviev
both
turned
up
on
the
sidewalk
of
the
boulevard
just
by
the
house
of
griboedov
s
aunt
koroviev
stood
by
the
fence
and
spoke
hah
this
is
the
writers
house
you
know
behemoth
i
ve
heard
many
good
and
flattering
things
about
this
house
pay
attention
to
this
house
my
friend
it
s
pleasant
to
think
how
under
this
roof
no
end
of
talents
are
being
sheltered
and
nurtured
like
pineapples
in
a
greenhouse
said
behemoth
and
the
better
to
admire
the
creamcoloured
building
with
columns
he
climbed
the
concrete
footing
of
the
castiron
fence
perfectly
correct
koroviev
agreed
with
his
inseparable
companion
and
a
sweet
awe
creeps
into
one
s
heart
at
the
thought
that
in
this
house
there
is
now
ripening
the
future
author
of
adon
quixote
or
afaust
or
devil
take
me
adead
souls
eh
frightful
to
think
of
agreed
behemoth
yes
koroviev
went
on
one
can
expect
astonishing
things
from
the
hotbeds
of
this
house
which
has
united
under
its
roof
several
thousand
zealots
resolved
to
devote
their
lives
to
the
service
of
melpomene
polyhymnia
and
thalia
you
can
imagine
the
noise
that
will
arise
when
one
of
them
for
starters
offers
the
reading
publicthe
inspector
general
or
if
worse
comes
to
worstevgeny
onegin
quite
easily
behemoth
again
agreed
yes
koroviev
went
on
anxiously
raising
his
finger
but
but
i
say
and
i
repeat
thisbut
only
if
these
tender
hothouse
plants
are
not
attacked
by
some
microorganism
that
gnaws
at
their
roots
so
that
they
rot
and
it
does
happen
with
pineapples
oh
my
does
it
incidentally
inquired
behemoth
putting
his
round
head
through
an
opening
in
the
fence
what
are
they
doing
on
the
veranda
having
dinner
explained
koroviev
and
to
that
i
will
add
my
dear
that
the
restaurant
here
is
inexpensive
and
not
bad
at
all
and
by
the
way
like
any
tourist
before
continuing
his
trip
i
feel
a
desire
to
have
a
bite
and
drink
a
big
icecold
mug
of
beer
me
too
replied
behemoth
and
the
two
blackguards
marched
down
the
asphalt
path
under
the
lindens
straight
to
the
veranda
of
the
unsuspecting
restaurant
a
pale
and
bored
citizeness
in
white
socks
and
a
white
beret
with
a
nib
sat
on
a
viennese
chair
at
the
comer
entrance
to
the
veranda
where
amid
the
greenery
of
the
trellis
an
opening
for
the
entrance
had
been
made
in
front
of
her
on
a
simple
kitchen
table
lay
a
fat
book
of
the
ledger
variety
in
which
the
citizeness
for
unknown
reasons
wrote
down
all
those
who
entered
the
restaurant
it
was
precisely
this
citizeness
who
stopped
koroviev
and
behemoth
your
identification
cards
she
was
gazing
in
amazement
at
koroviev
s
pincenez
and
also
at
behemoth
s
primus
and
behemoth
s
torn
elbow
a
thousand
pardons
but
what
identification
cards
asked
koroviev
in
surprise
you
re
writers
the
citizeness
asked
in
her
turn
unquestionably
koroviev
answered
with
dignity
your
identification
cards
the
citizeness
repeated
my
sweetie
koroviev
began
tenderly
i
m
no
sweetie
interrupted
the
citizeness
more
s
the
pity
koroviev
said
disappointedly
and
went
on
well
so
if
you
don
t
want
to
be
a
sweetie
which
would
be
quite
pleasant
you
don
t
have
to
be
so
then
to
convince
yourself
that
dostoevsky
was
a
writer
do
you
have
to
ask
for
his
identification
card
just
take
any
fivepages
from
any
one
of
his
novels
and
you
ll
be
convinced
without
any
identification
card
that
you
re
dealing
with
a
writer
and
i
don
t
think
he
even
had
any
identification
card
what
do
you
think
koroviev
turned
to
behemoth
i
ll
bet
he
didn
t
replied
behemoth
setting
the
primus
down
on
the
table
beside
the
ledger
and
wiping
the
sweat
from
his
sooty
forehead
with
his
hand
you
re
not
dostoevsky
said
the
citizeness
who
was
getting
muddled
by
koroviev
well
who
knows
who
knows
he
replied
dostoevsky
s
dead
said
the
citizeness
but
somehow
not
very
confidently
i
protest
behemoth
exclaimed
hotly
dostoevsky
is
immortal
your
identification
cards
citizens
said
the
citizeness
good
gracious
this
is
getting
to
be
ridiculous
koroviev
would
not
give
in
a
writer
is
defined
not
by
any
identity
card
but
by
what
he
writes
how
do
you
know
what
plots
are
swarming
in
my
head
or
in
this
head
and
he
pointed
at
behemoth
s
head
from
which
the
latter
at
once
removed
the
cap
as
if
to
let
the
citizeness
examine
it
better
step
aside
citizens
she
said
nervously
now
koroviev
and
behemoth
stepped
aside
and
let
pass
some
writer
in
a
grey
suit
with
a
tieless
summer
white
shirt
the
collar
of
which
lay
wide
open
on
the
lapels
of
his
jacket
and
with
a
newspaper
under
his
arm
the
writer
nodded
affably
to
the
citizeness
in
passing
put
some
flourish
in
the
proffered
ledger
and
proceeded
to
the
veranda
alas
not
to
us
not
to
us
koroviev
began
sadly
but
to
him
will
go
that
icecold
mug
of
beer
which
you
and
i
poor
wanderers
so
dreamed
of
together
our
position
is
woeful
and
difficult
and
i
don
t
know
what
to
do
behemoth
only
spread
his
arms
bitterly
and
put
his
cap
on
his
round
head
covered
with
thick
hair
very
much
resembling
a
cat
s
fur
and
at
that
moment
a
low
but
peremptory
voice
sounded
over
the
head
of
the
citizeness
let
them
pass
sofya
pavlovna
the
citizeness
with
the
ledger
was
amazed
amidst
the
greenery
of
the
trellis
appeared
the
white
tailcoated
chest
and
wedgeshaped
beard
of
the
freebooter
he
was
looking
affably
at
the
two
dubious
ragamuffins
and
moreover
even
making
inviting
gestures
to
them
archibald
archibaldovich
s
authority
was
something
seriously
felt
in
the
restaurant
under
his
management
and
sofya
pavlovna
obediently
asked
koroviev
what
is
your
name
panaev
he
answered
courteously
the
citizeness
wrote
this
name
down
and
raised
a
questioning
glance
to
behemoth
skabichevsky
the
latter
squeaked
for
some
reason
pointing
to
his
primus
sofya
pavlovna
wrote
this
down
too
and
pushed
the
book
towards
the
visitors
for
them
to
sign
koroviev
wrote
skabichevsky
next
to
the
name
panaev
and
behemoth
wrote
panaev
next
to
skabichevsky
archibald
archibaldovich
to
the
utter
amazement
of
sofya
pavlovna
smiled
seductively
and
led
the
guests
to
the
best
table
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
veranda
where
the
deepest
shade
lay
a
table
next
to
which
the
sun
played
merrily
through
one
of
the
gaps
in
the
trellis
greenery
while
sofya
pavlovna
blinking
with
amazement
studied
for
a
long
time
the
strange
entry
made
in
the
book
by
the
unexpected
visitors
archibald
archibaldovich
surprised
the
waiters
no
less
than
he
had
sofya
pavlovna
he
personally
drew
a
chair
back
from
the
table
inviting
koroviev
to
sit
down
winked
to
one
whispered
something
to
the
other
and
the
two
waiters
began
bustling
around
the
new
guests
one
of
whom
set
his
primus
down
on
the
floor
next
to
his
scuffed
shoe
the
old
yellowstained
tablecloth
immediately
disappeared
from
the
table
another
shot
up
into
the
air
crackling
with
starch
white
as
a
bedouin
s
burnous
and
archibald
archibaldovich
was
already
whispering
softly
but
very
significantly
bending
right
to
koroviev
s
ear
what
may
i
treat
you
to
i
have
a
special
littlebalyk
here
bagged
at
the
architects
congress
oh
just
give
us
a
bite
of
something
eh
koroviev
mumbled
goodnaturedly
sprawling
on
the
chair
i
understand
archibald
archibaldovich
replied
meaningfully
closing
his
eyes
seeing
the
way
the
chief
of
the
restaurant
treated
the
rather
dubious
visitors
the
waiters
laid
aside
their
suspicions
and
got
seriously
down
to
business
one
was
already
offering
a
match
to
behemoth
who
had
taken
a
butt
from
his
pocket
and
put
it
in
his
mouth
the
other
raced
up
clinking
with
green
glass
and
at
their
places
arranged
goblets
tumblers
and
those
thinwalled
glasses
from
which
it
is
so
nice
to
drink
seltzer
under
the
awning
no
skipping
ahead
let
us
say
it
used
to
be
so
nice
to
drink
seltzer
under
the
awning
of
the
unforgettable
griboedov
veranda
i
might
recommend
a
little
fillet
of
hazelgrouse
archibald
archibaldovich
murmured
musically
the
guest
in
the
cracked
pincenez
fully
approved
the
commander
of
the
brig
s
suggestions
and
gazed
at
him
benevolently
through
the
useless
bit
of
glass
the
fiction
writer
petrakovsukhovey
dining
at
the
next
table
with
his
wife
who
was
finishing
a
pork
chop
noticed
with
the
keenness
of
observation
proper
to
all
writers
the
wooing
of
archibald
archibaldovich
and
was
quite
quite
surprised
and
his
wife
a
very
respectable
lady
even
simply
became
jealous
of
koroviev
over
the
pirate
and
even
rapped
with
her
teaspoon
as
if
to
say
why
are
we
kept
waiting
it
s
time
the
ice
cream
was
served
what
s
the
matter
however
after
sending
mrs
petrakov
a
seductive
smile
archibald
archibaldovich
dispatched
a
waiter
to
her
but
did
not
leave
his
dear
guests
himself
ah
how
intelligent
archibald
archibaldovich
was
and
his
powers
of
observation
were
perhaps
no
less
keen
than
those
of
the
writers
themselves
archibald
archibaldovich
knew
about
the
seance
at
the
variety
and
about
many
other
events
of
those
days
he
had
heard
but
unlike
the
others
had
not
closed
his
ears
to
the
word
checkered
and
the
word
cat
archibald
archibaldovich
guessed
at
once
who
his
visitors
were
and
having
guessed
naturally
did
not
start
quarrelling
with
them
and
that
sofya
pavlovna
was
a
good
one
to
come
up
with
such
a
thing
barring
the
way
to
the
veranda
for
those
two
though
what
could
you
expect
of
her
haughtily
poking
her
little
spoon
into
the
slushy
ice
cream
mrs
petrakov
with
displeased
eyes
watched
the
table
in
front
of
the
two
motley
buffoons
become
overgrown
with
dainties
as
if
by
magic
shiny
clean
lettuce
leaves
were
already
sticking
from
a
bowl
of
fresh
caviar
an
instant
later
a
sweating
silver
bucket
appeared
brought
especially
on
a
separate
little
table
only
when
convinced
that
everything
had
been
done
impeccably
only
when
there
came
flying
in
the
waiter
s
hands
a
covered
pan
with
something
gurgling
in
it
did
archibald
archibaldovich
allow
himself
to
leave
the
two
mysterious
visitors
and
that
after
having
first
whispered
to
them
excuse
me
one
moment
i
ll
see
to
the
fillets
personally
he
flew
away
from
the
table
and
disappeared
into
an
inner
passage
of
the
restaurant
if
any
observer
had
been
able
to
follow
the
further
actions
of
archibald
archibaldovich
they
would
undoubtedly
have
seemed
somewhat
mysterious
to
him
the
chief
did
not
go
to
the
kitchen
to
supervise
the
fillets
at
all
but
went
to
the
restaurant
pantry
he
opened
it
with
his
own
key
locked
himself
inside
took
two
heftybalyks
from
the
icebox
carefully
so
as
not
to
soil
his
cuffs
wrapped
them
in
newspaper
tied
them
neatly
with
string
and
set
them
aside
then
he
made
sure
that
his
hat
and
silklined
summer
coat
were
in
place
in
the
next
room
and
only
after
that
proceeded
to
the
kitchen
where
the
chef
was
carefully
boning
the
fillets
the
pirate
had
promised
his
visitors
it
must
be
said
that
there
was
nothing
strange
or
incomprehensible
in
any
of
archibald
archibaldovich
s
actions
and
that
they
could
seem
strange
only
to
a
superficial
observer
archibald
archibaldovich
s
behaviour
was
the
perfectly
logical
result
of
all
that
had
gone
before
a
knowledge
of
the
latest
events
and
above
all
archibald
archibaldovich
s
phenomenal
intuition
told
the
chief
of
the
griboedov
restaurant
that
his
two
visitors
dinner
while
abundant
and
sumptuous
would
be
of
extremely
short
duration
and
his
intuition
which
had
never
yet
deceived
the
former
freebooter
did
not
let
him
down
this
time
either
just
as
koroviev
and
behemoth
were
clinking
their
second
glasses
of
wonderful
cold
doubledistilled
moskovskaya
vodka
the
sweaty
and
excited
chronicler
boba
kandalupsky
famous
in
moscow
for
his
astounding
omniscience
appeared
on
the
veranda
and
at
once
sat
down
with
the
petrakovs
placing
his
bulging
briefcase
on
the
table
boba
immediately
put
his
lips
to
petrakov
s
ear
and
whispered
some
very
tempting
things
into
it
madame
petrakov
burning
with
curiosity
also
put
her
ear
to
boba
s
plump
greasy
lips
and
he
with
an
occasional
furtive
look
around
went
on
whispering
and
whispering
and
one
could
make
out
separate
words
such
as
i
swear
to
you
on
sadovaya
on
sadovaya
boba
lowered
his
voice
still
more
bullets
have
no
effect
bullets
bullets
benzene
fire
bullets
it
s
the
liars
that
spread
these
vile
rumours
madame
petrakov
boomed
in
a
contralto
voice
somewhat
louder
in
her
indignation
than
boba
would
have
liked
they
re
the
ones
who
ought
to
be
explained
well
never
mind
that
s
how
it
will
be
they
ll
be
called
to
order
such
pernicious
lies
why
lies
antonida
porfirievna
exclaimed
boba
upset
by
the
disbelief
of
the
writer
s
wife
and
again
began
spinning
i
tell
you
bullets
have
no
effect
and
then
the
fire
they
went
up
in
the
air
in
the
air
boba
went
on
hissing
not
suspecting
that
those
he
was
talking
about
were
sitting
next
to
him
delighting
in
his
yarn
however
this
delight
soon
ceased
from
an
inner
passage
of
the
restaurant
three
men
their
waists
drawn
in
tightly
by
belts
wearing
leggings
and
holding
revolvers
in
their
hands
strode
precipitously
on
to
the
veranda
the
one
in
front
cried
ringingly
and
terribly
don
t
move
and
at
once
all
three
opened
fire
on
the
veranda
aiming
at
the
heads
of
koroviev
and
behemoth
the
two
objects
of
the
shooting
instantly
melted
into
air
and
a
pillar
of
fire
spurted
from
the
primus
directly
on
to
the
tent
roof
it
was
as
if
a
gaping
maw
with
black
edges
appeared
in
the
tent
and
began
spreading
in
all
directions
the
fire
leaping
through
it
rose
up
to
the
roof
of
griboedov
house
folders
full
of
papers
lying
on
the
windowsill
of
the
editorial
office
on
the
second
floor
suddenly
blazed
up
followed
by
the
curtains
and
now
the
fire
howling
as
if
someone
were
blowing
on
it
went
on
in
pillars
to
the
interior
of
the
aunt
s
house
a
few
seconds
later
down
the
asphalt
paths
leading
to
the
castiron
fence
on
the
boulevard
whence
ivanushka
the
first
herald
of
the
disaster
understood
by
no

had
come
on

petrakov

and
petrakov
now
went
running
leaving
their
dinners
unfinished
having
stepped
out
through
a
side
entrance
beforehand
not
fleeing
or
hurrying
anywhere
like
a
captain
who
must
be
the
last
to
leave
his
burning

stood
calmly
in

chapter
the
fate
of
the
master
and
margarita
is
decided
at
sunset
high
over
the
city
on
the
stone
terrace
of
one
of
the
most
beautiful
houses
in
moscow
a
house
built
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
there
were
two
woland
and
azazello
they
could
not
be
seen
from
the
street
below
because
they
were
hidden
from
unwanted
eyes
by
a
balustrade
with
plaster
vases
and
plaster
flowers
but
they
could
see
the
city
almost
to
its
very
edges
woland
was
sitting
on
a
folding
stool
dressed
in
his
black
soutane
his
long
and
broad
sword
was
stuck
vertically
into
a
crack
between
two
flags
of
the
terrace
so
as
to
make
a
sundial
the
shadow
of
the
sword
lengthened
slowly
and
steadily
creeping
towards
the
black
shoes
on
satan
s
feet
resting
his
sharp
chin
on
his
fist
hunched
on
the
stool
with
one
leg
drawn
under
him
woland
stared
fixedly
at
the
endless
collection
of
palaces
gigantic
buildings
and
little
hovels
destined
to
be
pulled
down
azazello
having
parted
with
his
modem
attire
that
is
jacket
bowler
hat
and
patentleather
shoes
and
dressed
like
woland
in
black
stood
motionless
not
far
from
his
sovereign
like
him
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
city
woland
began
to
speak
such
an
interesting
city
is
it
not
azazello
stirred
and
replied
respectfully
i
like
rome
better
messire
yes
it
s
a
matter
of
taste
replied
woland
after
a
while
his
voice
resounded
again
and
what
is
that
smoke
there
on
the
boulevard
that
is
griboedov
s
burning
replied
azazello
it
must
be
supposed
that
that
inseparable
pair
koroviev
and
behemoth
stopped
by
there
of
that
there
can
be
no
doubt
messire
again
silence
fell
and
the
two
on
the
terrace
gazed
at
the
fragmented
dazzling
sunlight
in
the
upperfloor
windows
of
the
huge
buildings
facing
west
woland
s
eye
burned
like
one
of
those
windows
though
woland
had
his
back
to
the
sunset
but
here
something
made
woland
turn
his
attention
to
the
round
tower
behind
him
on
the
roof
from
its
wall
stepped
a
tattered
claycovered
sullen
man
in
a
chiton
in
homemade
sandals
blackbearded
hah
exclaimed
woland
looking
mockingly
at
the
newcomer
least
of
all
would
i
expect
you
here
what
have
you
come
with
uninvited
guest
i
have
come
to
see
you
spirit
of
evil
and
sovereign
of
shadows
the
newcomer
replied
glowering
inimically
at
woland
if
you
ve
come
to
see
me
why
didn
t
you
wish
me
a
good
evening
former
tax
collector
woland
said
sternly
because
i
don
t
wish
you
a
good
anything
the
newcomer
replied
insolently
but
you
ll
have
to
reconcile
yourself
to
that
woland
objected
and
a
grin
twisted
his
mouth
you
no
sooner
appear
on
the
roof
than
you
produce
an
absurdity
and
i
ll
tell
you
what
it
is
it
s
your
intonation
you
uttered
your
words
as
if
you
don
t
acknowledge
shadows
or
evil
either
kindly
consider
the
question
what
would
your
good
do
if
evil
did
not
exist
and
what
would
the
earth
look
like
if
shadows
disappeared
from
it
shadows
are
cast
by
objects
and
people
here
is
the
shadow
of
my
sword
trees
and
living
beings
also
have
shadows
do
you
want
to
skin
the
whole
earth
tearing
all
the
trees
and
living
things
off
it
because
of
your
fantasy
of
enjoying
bare
light
you
re
a
fool
i
won
t
argue
with
you
old
sophist
replied
matthew
levi
you
also
cannot
argue
with
me
for
the
reason
i
ve
already
mentioned
you
re
a
fool
woland
replied
and
asked
well
make
it
short
don
t
weary
me
why
have
you
appeared
he
sent
me
what
did
he
tell
you
to
say
slave
i
m
not
a
slave
matthew
levi
replied
growing
ever
angrier
i
m
his
disciple
you
and
i
speak
different
languages
as
usual
responded
woland
but
the
things
we
say
don
t
change
for
all
that
and
so
he
has
read
the
master
s
work
said
matthew
levi
and
asks
you
to
take
the
master
with
you
and
reward
him
with
peace
is
that
hard
for
you
to
do
spirit
of
evil
nothing
is
hard
for
me
to
do
answered
woland
you
know
that
very
well
he
paused
and
added
but
why
don
t
you
take
him
with
you
into
the
light
he
does
not
deserve
the
light
he
deserves
peace
levi
said
in
a
sorrowful
voice
tell
him
it
will
be
done
woland
replied
and
added
his
eye
flashing
and
leave
me
immediately
he
asks
that
she
who
loved
him
and
suffered
because
of
him
also
be
taken
with
him
levi
addressed
woland
pleadingly
for
the
first
time
we
would
never
have
thought
of
it
without
you
go
matthew
levi
disappeared
after
that
and
woland
called
azazello
and
ordered
him
fly
to
them
and
arrange
it
all
azazello
left
the
terrace
and
woland
remained
alone
but
his
solitude
did
not
last
over
the
flags
of
the
terrace
came
the
sound
of
footsteps
and
animated
voices
and
before
woland
stood
koroviev
and
behemoth
but
now
the
fat
fellow
had
no
primus
with
him
but
was
loaded
with
other
things
thus
under
his
arm
he
had
a
small
landscape
in
a
gold
frame
from
one
hand
hung
a
halfburnt
cook
s
smock
and
in
the
other
he
held
a
whole
salmon
with
skin
and
tail
koroviev
and
behemoth
reeked
of
fire
behemoth
s
mug
was
all
sooty
and
his
cap
was
badly
burnt
greetings
messire
cried
the
irrepressible
pair
and
behemoth
waved
the
salmon
a
fine
sight
said
woland
imagine
messire
behemoth
cried
excitedly
and
joyfully
i
was
taken
for
a
looter
judging
by
the
things
you
ve
brought
woland
replied
glancing
at
the
landscape
you
are
a
looter
believe
me
messire
behemoth
began
in
a
soulful
voice
no
i
don
t
woland
replied
curtly
messire
i
swear
i
made
heroic
efforts
to
save
everything
i
could
and
this
is
all
i
was
able
to
rescue
you
d
better
tell
me
why
did
griboedov
s
catch
fire
asked
woland
both
koroviev
and
behemoth
spread
their
arms
raised
their
eyes
to
heaven
and
behemoth
cried
out
i
can
t
conceive
why
we
were
sitting
there
peacefully
perfectly
quiet
having
a
bite
to
eat
and
suddenly
bang
bang
koroviev
picked
up
gunshots
crazed
with
fear
behemoth
and
i
ran
out
to
the
boulevard
our
pursuers
followed
we
rushed
to
timiriazev
but
the
sense
of
duty
behemoth
put
in
overcame
our
shameful
fear
and
we
went
back
ah
you
went
back
said
woland
well
then
of
course
the
building
was
reduced
to
ashes
to
ashes
koroviev
ruefully
confirmed
that
is
messire
literally
to
ashes
as
you
were
pleased
to
put
it
so
aptly
nothing
but
embers
i
hastened
behemoth
narrated
to
the
meeting
room
the
one
with
the
columns
messire
hoping
to
bring
out
something
valuable
ah
messire
my
wife
if
only
i
had
one
was
twenty
times
in
danger
of
being
left
a
widow
but
happily
messire
i
m
not
married
and
let
me
tell
you
i
m
really
happy
that
i
m
not
ah
messire
how
can
one
trade
a
bachelor
s
freedom
for
the
burdensome
yoke
again
some
gibberish
gets
going
observed
woland
i
hear
and
continue
the
cat
replied
yes
sir
this
landscape
here
it
was
impossible
to
bring
anything
more
out
of
the
meeting
room
the
flames
were
beating
in
my
face
i
ran
to
the
pantry
and
rescued
the
salmon
i
ran
to
the
kitchen
and
rescued
the
smock
i
think
messire
that
i
did
everything
i
could
and
i
don
t
understand
how
to
explain
the
sceptical
expression
on
your
face
and
what
did
koroviev
do
while
you
were
looting
asked
woland
i
was
helping
the
firemen
messire
replied
koroviev
pointing
to
his
torn
trousers
ah
if
so
then
of
course
a
new
building
will
have
to
be
built
it
will
be
built
messire
koroviev
responded
i
venture
to
assure
you
of
that
well
so
it
remains
for
us
to
wish
that
it
be
better
than
the
old
one
observed
woland
it
will
be
messire
said
koroviev
you
can
believe
me
the
cat
added
i
m
a
regular
prophet
in
any
case
we
re
here
messire
koroviev
reported
and
await
your
orders
woland
got
up
from
his
stool
went
over
to
the
balustrade
and
alone
silently
his
back
turned
to
his
retinue
gazed
into
the
distance
for
a
long
time
then
he
stepped
away
from
the
edge
lowered
himself
on
to
his
stool
and
said
there
will
be
no
orders
you
have
fulfilled
all
you
could
and
for
the
moment
i
no
longer
need
your
services
you
may
rest
right
now
a
storm
is
coming
the
last
storm
it
will
complete
all
that
needs
completing
and
we
ll
be
on
our
way
very
well
messire
the
two
buffoons
replied
and
disappeared
somewhere
behind
the
round
central
tower
which
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
terrace
the
storm
of
which
woland
had
spoken
was
already
gathering
on
the
horizon
a
black
cloud
rose
in
the
west
and
cut
off
half
the
sun
then
it
covered
it
entirely
the
air
became
cool
on
the
terrace
a
little
later
it
turned
dark
this
darkness
which
came
from
the
west
covered
the
vast
city
bridges
and
palaces
disappeared
everything
vanished
as
if
it
had
never
existed
in
the
world
one
fiery
thread
ran
across
the
whole
sky
then
a
thunderclap
shook
the
city
it
was
repeated
and
the
storm
began
woland
could
no
longer
be
seen
in
its
gloom
chapter
it
s
time
it
s
time
you
know
said
margarita
just
as
you
fell
asleep
last
night
i
was
reading
about
the
darkness
that
came
from
the
mediterranean
sea
and
those
idols
ah
the
golden
idols
for
some
reason
they
never
leave
me
in
peace
i
think
it
s
going
to
rain
now
too
do
you
feel
how
cool
it
s
getting
that
s
all
well
and
good
replied
the
master
smoking
and
breaking
up
the
smoke
with
his
hand
and
as
for
the
idols
god
be
with
them
but
what
will
happen
further
on
is
decidedly
unclear
this
conversation
occurred
at
sunset
just
at
the
moment
when
matthew
levi
came
to
woland
on
the
terrace
the
basement
window
was
open
and
if
anyone
had
looked
through
it
he
would
have
been
astonished
at
how
strange
the
talkers
looked
margarita
had
a
black
cloak
thrown
directly
over
her
naked
body
and
the
master
was
in
his
hospital
underwear
the
reason
for
this
was
that
margarita
had
decidedly
nothing
to
put
on
because
all
her
clothes
had
stayed
in
her
house
and
though
this
house
was
very
near
by
there
was
of
course
no
question
of
going
there
to
take
her
clothes
and
the
master
whose
clothes
were
all
found
in
the
wardrobe
as
if
he
had
never
gone
anywhere
simply
did
not
want
to
get
dressed
developing
before
margarita
the
thought
that
some
perfect
nonsense
was
about
to
begin
at
any
moment
true
he
was
cleanshaven
for
the
first
time
since
that
autumn
night
in
the
clinic
his
beard
had
been
cut
with
clippers
the
room
also
had
a
strange
look
and
it
was
very
hard
to
make
anything
out
in
its
chaos
manuscripts
were
lying
on
the
rug
and
on
the
sofa
as
well
a
book
sat
humpbacked
on
an
armchair
and
dinner
was
set
out
on
the
round
table
with
several
bottles
standing
among
the
dishes
of
food
where
all
this
food
and
drink
came
from
was
known
neither
to
margarita
nor
to
the
master
on
waking
up
they
found
everything
already
on
the
table
having
slept
until
sunset
saturday
the
master
and
his
friend
felt
themselves
thoroughly
fortified
and
only
one
thing
told
of
the
previous
day
s
adventure
both
had
a
slight
ache
in
the
left
temple
but
with
regard
to
their
minds
there
were
great
changes
in
both
of
them
as
anyone
would
have
been
convinced
who
was
able
to
eavesdrop
on
the
conversation
in
the
basement
but
there
was
decidedly
no
one
to
eavesdrop
that
little
courtyard
was
good
precisely
for
being
always
empty
with
each
day
the
greening
lindens
and
the
ivy
outside
the
window
exuded
an
ever
stronger
smell
of
spring
and
the
rising
breeze
carried
it
into
the
basement
pah
the
devil
exclaimed
the
master
unexpectedly
but
just
think
it
s
he
put
out
his
cigarette
butt
in
the
ashtray
and
pressed
his
head
with
his
hands
no
listen
you
re
an
intelligent
person
and
have
never
been
crazy
are
you
seriously
convinced
that
we
were
at
satan
s
yesterday
quite
seriously
margarita
replied
of
course
of
course
the
master
said
ironically
so
now
instead
of
one
madman
there
are
two
husband
and
wife
he
raised
his
hands
to
heaven
and
cried
no
the
devil
knows
what
this
is
the
devil
the
devil
instead
of
answering
margarita
collapsed
on
the
sofa
burst
out
laughing
waved
her
bare
legs
and
only
then
cried
out
aie
i
can
t
i
can
t
you
should
see
what
you
look
like
having
finished
laughing
while
the
master
bashfully
pulled
up
his
hospital
drawers
margarita
became
serious
you
unwittingly
spoke
the
truth
just
now
she
began
the
devil
knows
what
it
is
and
the
devil
believe
me
will
arrange
everything
her
eyes
suddenly
flashed
she
jumped
up
and
began
dancing
on
the
spot
crying
out
how
happy
i
am
how
happy
i
am
how
happy
i
am
that
i
struck
a
bargain
with
him
oh
satan
satan
you
ll
have
to
live
with
a
witch
my
dear
then
she
rushed
to
the
master
put
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
began
kissing
his
lips
his
nose
his
cheeks
strands
of
unkempt
black
hair
leaped
at
the
master
and
his
cheeks
and
forehead
burned
under
the
kisses
and
you
ve
really
come
to
resemble
a
witch
and
i
don
t
deny
it
answered
margarita
i
m
a
witch
and
i
m
very
glad
of
it
well
all
right
said
the
master
so
you
re
a
witch
very
nice
splendid
and
i
ve
been
stolen
from
the
hospital
also
very
nice
i
ve
been
brought
here
let
s
grant
that
too
let
s
even
suppose
that
we
won
t
be
missed
but
tell
me
by
all
that
s
holy
how
and
on
what
are
we
going
to
live
my
concern
is
for
you
when
i
say
that
believe
me
at
that
moment
roundtoed
shoes
and
the
lower
part
of
a
pair
of
pinstriped
trousers
appeared
in
the
window
then
the
trousers
bent
at
the
knee
and
somebody
s
hefty
backside
blocked
the
daylight
aloisy
are
you
home
asked
a
voice
somewhere
up
above
the
trousers
outside
the
window
there
it
s
beginning
said
the
master
aloisy
asked
margarita
going
closer
to
the
window
he
was
arrested
yesterday
who
s
asking
for
him
what
s
your
name
that
instant
the
knees
and
backside
vanished
there
came
the
bang
of
the
gate
after
which
everything
returned
to
normal
margarita
collapsed
on
the
sofa
and
laughed
so
that
tears
poured
from
her
eyes
but
when
she
calmed
down
her
countenance
changed
greatly
she
began
speaking
seriously
and
as
she
spoke
she
slipped
down
from
the
couch
crept
over
to
the
master
s
knees
and
looking
into
his
eyes
began
to
caress
his
head
how
you
ve
suffered
how
you
ve
suffered
my
poor
one
i
m
the
only
one
who
knows
it
look
you
ve
got
white
threads
in
your
hair
and
an
eternal
crease
by
your
lips
my
only
one
my
dearest
don
t
think
about
anything
you
ve
had
to
think
too
much
and
now
i
ll
think
for
you
and
i
promise
you
i
promise
that
everything
will
be
dazzlingly
well
i
m
not
afraid
of
anything
margot
the
master
suddenly
answered
her
and
raised
his
head
and
he
seemed
to
her
the
same
as
he
had
been
when
he
was
inventing
that
which
he
had
never
seen
but
of
which
he
knew
for
certain
that
it
had
been
not
afraid
because
i
ve
already
experienced
it
all
they
tried
too
hard
to
frighten
me
and
cannot
frighten
me
with
anything
any
more
but
i
pity
you
margot
that
s
the
trick
that
s
why
i
keep
saying
it
over
and
over
come
to
your
senses
why
do
you
have
to
ruin
your
life
with
a
sick
man
and
a
beggar
go
back
i
pity
you
that
s
why
i
say
it
oh
you
you
margarita
whispered
shaking
her
dishevelled
head
oh
you
faithless
unfortunate
man
because
of
you
i
spent
the
whole
night
yesterday
shivering
and
naked
i
lost
my
nature
and
replaced
it
with
a
new
one
i
spent
several
months
sitting
in
a
dark
closet
thinking
about
one
thing
about
the
storm
over
yershalaim
i
cried
my
eyes
out
and
now
when
happiness
has
befallen
us
you
drive
me
away
well
then
i
ll
go
i
ll
go
but
you
should
know
that
you
are
a
cruel
man
they
ve
devastated
your
soul
bitter
tenderness
rose
up
in
the
master
s
heart
and
without
knowing
why
he
began
to
weep
burying
his
face
in
margarita
s
hair
weeping
herself
she
whispered
to
him
and
her
fingers
trembled
on
the
master
s
temples
yes
threads
threads
before
my
eyes
your
head
is
getting
covered
with
snow
ah
my
muchsuffering
head
look
what
eyes
you
ve
got
there
s
a
desert
in
them
and
the
shoulders
the
shoulders
with
their
burden
crippled
crippled
margarita
s
speech
was
becoming
incoherent
margarita
was
shaking
with
tears
then
the
master
wiped
his
eyes
raised
margarita
from
her
knees
got
up
himself
and
said
firmly
enough
you
ve
shamed
me
never
again
will
i
yield
to
faintheartedness
or
come
back
to
this
question
be
reassured
i
know
that
we
re
both
the
victims
of
our
mental
illness
which
you
perhaps
got
from
me
well
so
we
ll
bear
it
together
margarita
put
her
lips
close
to
the
master
s
ear
and
whispered
i
swear
to
you
by
your
life
i
swear
by
the
astrologer
s
son
whom
you
guessed
that
all
will
be
well
fine
fine
responded
the
master
and
he
added
laughing
of
course
when
people
have
been
robbed
of
everything
like
you
and
me
they
seek
salvation
from
otherworldly
powers
well
so
i
agree
to
seek
there
well
there
there
now
you
re
your
old
self
you
re
laughing
replied
margarita
and
devil
take
you
with
your
learned
words
otherworldly
or
not
otherworldly
isn
t
it
all
the
same
i
want
to
eat
and
she
dragged
the
master
to
the
table
by
the
hand
i
m
not
sure
this
food
isn
t
about
to
fall
through
the
floor
or
fly
out
the
window
he
said
now
completely
calm
it
won
t
fly
out
and
just
then
a
nasal
voice
came
through
the
window
peace
be
unto
you
the
master
gave
a
start
but
margarita
already
accustomed
to
the
extraordinary
exclaimed
why
it
s
azazello
ah
how
nice
how
good
and
whispering
to
the
master
you
see
you
see
we
re
not
abandoned
she
rushed
to
open
the
door
cover
yourself
at
least
the
master
called
after
her
spit
on
it
answered
margarita
already
in
the
corridor
and
there
was
azazello
bowing
greeting
the
master
and
flashing
his
blind
eye
while
margarita
exclaimed
ah
how
glad
i
am
i
ve
never
been
so
glad
in
my
life
but
forgive
me
azazello
for
being
naked
azazello
begged
her
not
to
worry
assuring
her
that
he
had
seen
not
only
naked
women
but
even
women
with
their
skin
flayed
clean
off
and
willingly
sat
down
at
the
table
having
first
placed
some
package
wrapped
in
dark
brocade
in
the
comer
by
the
stove
margarita
poured
azazello
some
cognac
and
he
willingly
drank
it
the
master
not
taking
his
eyes
off
him
quietly
pinched
his
own
left
hand
under
the
table
but
the
pinches
did
not
help
azazello
did
not
melt
into
air
and
to
tell
the
truth
there
was
no
need
for
that
there
was
nothing
terrible
in
the
short
reddishhaired
man
unless
it
was
his
eye
with
albugo
but
that
occurs
even
without
sorcery
or
unless
his
clothes
were
not
quite
ordinary
some
sort
of
cassock
or
cloak
but
again
strictly
considered
that
also
happens
he
drank
his
cognac
adroitly
too
as
all
good
people
do
by
the
glassful
and
without
nibbling
from
this
same
cognac
the
master
s
head
became
giddy
and
he
began
to
think
no
margarita
s
right
of
course
this
is
the
devil
s
messenger
sitting
before
me
no
more
than
two
nights
ago
i
myself
tried
to
prove
to
ivan
that
it
was
precisely
satan
whom
he
had
met
at
the
patriarch
s
ponds
and
now
for
some
reason
i
got
scared
of
the
thought
and
started
babbling
something
about
hypnotists
and
hallucinations
devil
there
s
any
hypnotists
in
it
he
began
looking
at
azazello
more
closely
and
became
convinced
that
there
was
some
constraint
in
his
eyes
some
thought
that
he
would
not
reveal
before
its
time
this
is
not
just
a
visit
he
s
come
on
some
errand
thought
the
master
his
powers
of
observation
did
not
deceive
him
after
drinking
a
third
glass
of
cognac
which
produced
no
effect
in
azazello
the
visitor
spoke
thus
a
cosy
little
basement
devil
take
me
only
one
question
arises
what
is
there
to
do
in
this
little
basement
that
s
just
what
i
was
saying
the
master
answered
laughing
why
do
you
trouble
me
azazello
asked
margarita
we
ll
live
somehow
or
other
please
please
cried
azazello
i
never
even
thought
of
troubling
you
i
say
the
same
thing
somehow
or
other
ah
yes
i
almost
forgot
messire
sends
his
regards
and
has
also
asked
me
to
tell
you
that
he
invites
you
to
go
on
a
little
excursion
with
him
if
you
wish
of
course
what
do
you
say
to
that
margarita
nudged
the
master
under
the
table
with
her
leg
with
great
pleasure
replied
the
master
studying
azazello
who
continued
we
hope
that
margarita
nikolaevna
will
also
not
decline
the
invitation
i
certainly
will
not
said
margarita
and
again
her
leg
brushed
against
the
master
s
a
wonderful
thing
exclaimed
azazello
i
like
that
one
two
and
it
s
done
not
like
that
time
in
the
alexandrovsky
garden
ah
don
t
remind
me
azazello
i
was
stupid
then
and
anyhow
you
mustn
t
blame
me
too
severely
for
it
you
don
t
meet
unclean
powers
every
day
that
you
don
t
agreed
azazello
wouldn
t
it
be
pleasant
if
it
was
every
day
i
like
quickness
myself
margarita
said
excitedly
i
like
quickness
and
nakedness
like
from
a
mauser
bang
ah
how
he
shoots
margarita
cried
turning
to
the
master
a
seven
under
the
pillow
any
pip
you
like
margarita
was
getting
drunk
and
it
made
her
eyes
blaze
and
again
i
forgot
cried
azazello
slapping
himself
on
the
forehead
i
m
quite
frazzled
messire
sends
you
a
present
here
he
adverted
precisely
to
the
master
a
bottle
of
wine
i
beg
you
to
note
that
it
s
the
same
wine
the
procurator
of
judea
drank
falemian
wine
it
was
perfectly
natural
that
such
a
rarity
should
arouse
great
attention
in
both
margarita
and
the
master
azazello
drew
from
the
piece
of
dark
coffin
brocade
a
completely
mouldy
jug
the
wine
was
sniffed
poured
into
glasses
held
up
to
the
light
in
the
window
which
was
disappearing
before
the
storm
to
woland
s
health
exclaimed
margarita
raising
her
glass
all
three
put
their
glasses
to
their
lips
and
took
big
gulps
at
once
the
prestorm
light
began
to
fade
in
the
master
s
eyes
his
breath
failed
him
and
he
felt
the
end
coming
he
could
still
see
the
deathly
pale
margarita
helplessly
reaching
her
arms
out
to
him
drop
her
head
to
the
table
and
then
slide
down
on
the
floor
poisoner
the
master
managed
to
cry
out
he
wanted
to
snatch
the
knife
from
the
table
and
strike
azazello
with
it
but
his
hand
slid
strengthlessly
from
the
tablecloth
everything
around
the
master
in
the
basement
took
on
a
black
colour
and
then
vanished
altogether
he
fell
backwards
and
infalling
cut
the
skin
of
his
temple
on
the
comer
of
his
desk
when
the
poisoned
ones
lay
still
azazello
began
to
act
first
of
all
he
rushed
out
of
the
window
and
a
few
instants
later
was
in
the
house
where
margarita
nikolaevna
lived
the
ever
precise
and
accurate
azazello
wanted
to
make
sure
that
everything
was
carried
out
properly
and
everything
turned
out
to
be
in
perfect
order
azazello
saw
a
gloomy
woman
who
was
waiting
for
her
husband
s
return
come
out
of
her
bedroom
suddenly
turn
pale
clutch
her
heart
and
cry
helplessly
natasha
somebody
come
and
fall
to
the
floor
in
the
living
room
before
reaching
the
study
everything
s
in
order
said
azazello
a
moment
later
he
was
beside
the
fallen
lovers
margarita
lay
with
her
face
against
the
little
rug
with
his
iron
hands
azazello
turned
her
over
like
a
doll
face
to
him
and
peered
at
her
the
face
of
the
poisoned
woman
was
changing
before
his
eyes
even
in
the
gathering
dusk
of
the
storm
one
could
see
the
temporary
witch
s
cast
in
her
eyes
and
the
cruelty
and
violence
of
her
features
disappear
the
face
of
the
dead
woman
brightened
and
finally
softened
and
the
look
of
her
bared
teeth
was
no
longer
predatory
but
simply
that
of
a
suffering
woman
then
azazello
unclenched
her
white
teeth
and
poured
into
her
mouth
several
drops
of
the
same
wine
with
which
he
had
poisoned
her
margarita
sighed
began
to
rise
without
azazello
s
help
sat
up
and
asked
weakly
why
azazello
why
what
have
you
done
to
me
she
saw
the
outstretched
master
shuddered
and
whispered
i
didn
t
expect
this
murderer
oh
no
no
answered
azazello
he
ll
rise
presently
ah
why
are
you
so
nervous
margarita
believed
him
at
once
so
convincing
was
the
redheaded
demon
s
voice
she
jumped
up
strong
and
alive
and
helped
to
give
the
outstretched
man
a
drink
of
wine
opening
his
eyes
he
gave
a
dark
look
and
with
hatred
repeated
his
last
word
poisoner
ah
insults
are
the
usual
reward
for
a
good
job
replied
azazello
are
you
blind
well
quickly
recover
your
sight
here
the
master
rose
looked
around
with
alive
and
bright
eyes
and
asked
what
does
this
new
thing
mean
it
means
replied
azazello
that
it
s
time
for
us
to
go
the
storm
is
already
thundering
do
you
hear
it
s
getting
dark
the
steeds
are
pawing
the
ground
your
little
garden
is
shuddering
say
farewell
quickly
say
farewell
to
your
little
basement
ah
i
understand
the
master
said
glancing
around
you
ve
killed
us
we
re
dead
oh
how
intelligent
that
is
and
how
timely
now
i
understand
everything
oh
for
pity
s
sake
replied
azazello
is
it
you
i
hear
talking
your
friend
calls
you
a
master
you
can
think
so
how
can
you
be
dead
is
it
necessary
in
order
to
consider
yourself
alive
to
sit
in
a
basement
and
dress
yourself
in
a
shirt
and
hospital
drawers
it
s
ridiculous
i
understand
everything
you
re
saying
the
master
cried
out
don
t
go
on
you
re
a
thousand
times
right
great
woland
margarita
began
to
echo
him
great
woland
he
thought
it
out
much
better
than
i
did
but
the
novel
the
novel
she
shouted
to
the
master
take
the
novel
with
you
wherever
you
fly
no
need
replied
the
master
i
remember
it
by
heart
but
you
won
t
you
won
t
forget
a
single
word
of
it
margarita
asked
pressing
herself
to
her
lover
and
wiping
the
blood
from
his
cut
temple
don
t
worry
i
ll
never
forget
anything
now
he
replied
fire
then
cried
azazello
fire
with
which
all
began
and
with
which
we
end
it
all
fire
margarita
cried
terribly
the
little
basement
window
banged
the
curtain
was
beaten
aside
by
the
wind
the
sky
thundered
merrily
and
briefly
azazello
thrust
his
clawed
hand
into
the
stove
pulled
out
a
smoking
brand
and
set
fire
to
the
tablecloth
then
he
set
fire
to
the
stack
of
old
newspapers
on
the
sofa
and
next
to
the
manuscripts
and
the
window
curtain
the
master
already
drunk
with
the
impending
ride
flung
some
book
from
the
shelf
on
to
the
table
ruffled
its
pages
in
the
flame
of
the
tablecloth
and
the
book
blazed
up
merrily
burn
burn
former
life
burn
suffering
cried
margarita
the
room
was
already
swaying
in
crimson
pillars
and
along
with
the
smoke
the
three
ran
out
of
the
door
went
up
the
stone
steps
and
came
to
the
yard
the
first
thing
they
saw
there
was
the
landlord
s
cook
sitting
on
the
ground
beside
her
lay
spilled
potatoes
and
several
bunches
of
onions
the
cook
s
state
was
comprehensible
three
black
steeds
snorted
by
the
shed
twitching
sending
up
fountains
of
earth
margarita
mounted
first
then
azazello
and
last
the
master
the
cook
moaned
and
wanted
to
raise
her
hand
to
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
but
azazello
shouted
menacingly
from
the
saddle
i
ll
cut
your
hand
off
he
whistled
and
the
steeds
breaking
through
the
linden
branches
soared
up
and
pierced
the
low
black
cloud
smoke
poured
at
once
from
the
basement
window
from
below
came
the
weak
pitiful
cry
of
the
cook
we
re
on
fire
the
steeds
were
already
racing
over
the
rooftops
of
moscow
i
want
to
bid
farewell
to
the
city
the
master
cried
to
azazello
who
rode
at
their
head
thunder
ate
up
the
end
of
the
master
s
phrase
azazello
nodded
and
sent
his
horse
into
a
gallop
the
dark
cloud
flew
precipitously
to
meet
the
fliers
but
as
yet
gave
not
a
sprinkle
of
rain
they
flew
over
the
boulevards
they
saw
little
figures
of
people
scatter
running
for
shelter
from
the
rain
the
first
drops
were
falling
they
flew
over
smoke
all
that
remained
of
griboedov
house
they
flew
over
the
city
which
was
already
being
flooded
by
darkness
over
them
lightning
flashed
soon
the
roofs
gave
place
to
greenery
only
then
did
the
rain
pour
down
transforming
the
fliers
into
three
huge
bubbles
in
the
water
margarita
was
already
familiar
with
the
sensation
of
flight
but
the
master
was
not
and
he
marvelled
at
how
quickly
they
reached
their
goal
the
one
to
whom
he
wished
to
bid
farewell
because
he
had
no
one
else
to
bid
farewell
to
he
immediately
recognized
through
the
veil
of
rain
the
building
of
stravinsky
s
clinic
the
river
and
the
pine
woods
on
the
other
bank
which
he
had
studied
so
well
they
came
down
in
the
clearing
of
a
copse
not
far
from
the
clinic
i
ll
wait
for
you
here
cried
azazello
his
hands
to
his
mouth
now
lit
up
by
lightning
now
disappearing
behind
the
grey
veil
say
your
farewells
but
be
quick
the
master
and
margarita
jumped
from
their
saddles
and
flew
flickering
like
watery
shadows
through
the
clinic
garden
a
moment
later
the
master
with
an
accustomed
hand
was
pushing
aside
the
balcony
grille
of
room
no
margarita
followed
after
him
they
stepped
into
ivanushka
s
room
unseen
and
unnoticed
in
the
rumbling
and
howling
of
the
storm
the
master
stopped
by
the
bed
ivanushka
lay
motionless
as
before
when
for
the
first
time
he
had
watched
a
storm
in
the
house
of
his
repose
but
he
was
not
weeping
as
he
had
been
then
once
he
had
taken
a
good
look
at
the
dark
silhouette
that
burst
into
his
room
from
the
balcony
he
raised
himself
held
out
his
hands
and
said
joyfully
ah
it
s
you
and
i
kept
waiting
and
waiting
for
you
and
here
you
are
my
neighbour
to
this
the
master
replied
i
m
here
but
unfortunately
i
cannot
be
your
neighbour
any
longer
i
m
flying
away
for
ever
and
i
ve
come
to
you
only
to
say
farewell
i
knew
that
i
guessed
it
ivan
replied
quietly
and
asked
you
met
him
yes
said
the
master
i
ve
come
to
say
farewell
to
you
because
you
are
the
only
person
i
ve
talked
with
lately
ivanushka
brightened
up
and
said
it
s
good
that
you
stopped
off
here
i
ll
keep
my
word
i
won
t
write
any
more
poems
i
m
interested
in
something
else
now
ivanushka
smiled
and
with
mad
eyes
looked
somewhere
past
the
master
i
want
to
write
something
else
you
know
while
i
lay
here
a
lot
became
clear
to
me
the
master
was
excited
by
these
words
and
sitting
on
the
edge
of
ivanushka
s
bed
said
ah
but
that
s
good
that
s
good
you
ll
write
a
sequel
about
him
ivanushka
s
eyes
lit
up
but
won
t
you
do
that
yourself
here
he
hung
his
head
and
added
pensively
ah
yes
what
am
i
asking
ivanushka
looked
sidelong
at
the
floor
his
eyes
fearful
yes
said
the
master
and
his
voice
seemed
unfamiliar
and
hollow
to
ivanushka
i
won
t
write
about
him
any
more
now
i
ll
be
occupied
with
other
things
a
distant
whistle
cut
through
the
noise
of
the
storm
do
you
hear
asked
the
master
the
noise
of
the
storm
no
i
m
being
called
it
s
time
for
me
to
go
explained
the
master
and
he
got
up
from
the
bed
wait
one
word
more
begged
ivan
did
you
find
her
did
she
remain
faithful
to
you
here
she
is
the
master
replied
and
pointed
to
the
wall
the
dark
margarita
separated
from
the
white
wall
and
came
up
to
the
bed
she
looked
at
the
young
man
lying
there
and
sorrow
could
be
read
in
her
eyes
poor
boy
poor
boy
margarita
whispered
soundlessly
and
bent
down
to
the
bed
she
s
so
beautiful
ivan
said
without
envy
but
sadly
and
with
a
certain
quiet
tenderness
look
how
well
everything
has
turned
out
for
you
but
not
so
for
me
here
he
thought
a
little
and
added
thoughtfully
or
else
maybe
it
is
so
it
is
so
it
is
so
whispered
margarita
and
she
bent
closer
to
him
i
m
going
to
kiss
you
now
and
everything
will
be
as
it
should
be
with
you
believe
me
in
that
i
ve
seen
everything
i
know
everything
the
young
man
put
his
arms
around
her
neck
and
she
kissed
him
farewell
disciple
the
master
said
barely
audibly
and
began
melting
into
air
he
disappeared
and
margarita
disappeared
with
him
the
balcony
grille
was
closed
ivanushka
fell
into
anxiety
he
sat
up
in
bed
looked
around
uneasily
even
moaned
began
talking
to
himself
got
up
the
storm
raged
more
and
more
and
evidently
stirred
up
his
soul
he
was
also
upset
by
the
troubling
footsteps
and
muted
voices
that
his
ear
accustomed
to
the
constant
silence
heard
outside
the
door
he
called
out
now
nervous
and
trembling
praskovya
fyodorovna
praskovya
fyodorovna
was
already
coming
into
the
room
looking
at
ivanushka
questioningly
and
uneasily
what
what
is
it
she
asked
the
storm
upsets
you
never
mind
never
mind
we
ll
help
you
now
i
ll
call
the
doctor
now
no
praskovya
fyodorovna
you
needn
t
call
the
doctor
said
ivanushka
looking
anxiously
not
at
praskovya
fyodorovna
but
into
the
wall
there
s
nothing
especially
the
matter
with
me
i
can
sort
things
out
now
don
t
worry
but
you
d
better
tell
me
ivan
begged
soulfully
whatjust

in
room
oneeighteen
eighteen
praskovya
fyodorovna
repeated
and
her
eyes
became
furtive
why
nothing
happened
there
but
her
voice
was
false
ivanushka
noticed
it
at
once
and
said
eh
praskovya
fyodorovna
you
re
such
a
truthful
person
you
think
i
ll
get
violent
no
praskovya
fyodorovna
that

better
speak
directly
for
i
can
feel
everything
through
the
wall
your
neighbour
has
just
passed
away
whispered
praskovya
fyodorovna
unable
to
overcome
her
truthfulness
and
kindness
and
all
clothed
in
a
flash
of
lightning
she
looked
fearfully
at
ivanushka
but
nothing
terrible
happened
to
ivanushka
he
only
raised
his
finger
significantly
and
said
i
knew
it
i
assure
you
praskovya
fyodorovna
that
yet
another
person
has
just
passed
away
in
the
city
i
even
know
who
here
ivanushka
smiled
mysteriously
it
s
a
woman
chapter
on
sparrow
hills
the
storm
was
swept
away
without
a
trace
and
a
multicoloured
rainbow
its
arch
thrown
across
all
of
moscow
stood
in
the
sky
drinking
water
from
the
moscow
river
high
up
on
a
hill
between
two
copses
three
dark
silhouettes
could
be
seen
woland
koroviev
and
behemoth
sat
in
the
saddle
on
three
black
horses
looking
at
the
city
spread
out
beyond
the
river
with
the
fragmented
sun
glittering
in
thousands
of
windows
facing
west
and
at
the
gingerbread
towers
of
the
devichy
convent
there
was
a
noise
in
the
air
and
azazello
who
had
the
master
and
margarita
flying
in
the
black
tail
of
his
cloak
alighted
with
them
beside
the
waiting
group
we
had
to
trouble
you
a
little
margarita
nikolaevna
and
master
woland
began
after
some
silence
but
you
won
t
grudge
me
that
i
don
t
think
you
will
regret
it
so
then
he
addressed
the
master
alone
bid
farewell
to
the
city
it
s
time
for
us
to
go
woland
pointed
with
his
blackgauntleted
hand
to
where
numberless
suns
melted
the
glass
beyond
the
river
to
where
above
these
suns
stood
the
mist
smoke
and
steam
of
the
city
scorched
all
day
the
master
threw
himself
out
of
the
saddle
left
the
mounted
ones
and
ran
to
the
edge
of
the
hillside
the
black
cloak
dragged
on
the
ground
behind
him
the
master
began
to
look
at
the
city
in
the
first
moments
a
wringing
sadness
crept
over
his
heart
but
it
very
quickly
gave
way
to
a
sweetish
anxiety
a
wondering
gypsy
excitement
for
ever
that
needs
to
be
grasped
the
master
whispered
and
licked
his
dry
cracked
lips
he
began
to
heed
and
take
precise
note
of
everything
that
went
on
in
his
soul
his
excitement
turned
as
it
seemed
to
him
into
a
feeling
of
deep
and
grievous
offence
but
it
was
unstable
vanishedand
gave
way
for
some
reason
to
a
haughty
indifference
and
that
to
a
foretaste
of
enduring
peace
the
group
of
riders
waited
silently
for
the
master
the
group
of
riders
watched
the
black
long
figure
on
the
edge
of
the
hillside
gesticulate
now
raising
his
head
as
if
trying
to
reach
across
the
whole
city
with
his
eyes
to
peer
beyond
its
limits
now
hanging
his
head
down
as
if
studying
the
trampled
meagre
grass
under
his
feet
the
silence
was
broken
by
the
bored
behemoth
allow
me
maitre
he
began
to
give
a
farewell
whistle
before
the
ride
you
may
frighten
the
lady
woland
answered
and
besides
don
t
forget
that
all
your
outrages
today
are
now
at
an
end
ah
no
no
messire
responded
margarita
who
sat
sidesaddle
arms
akimbo
the
sharp
comer
of
her
train
hanging
to
the
ground
allow
him
let
him
whistle
i
m
overcome
with
sadness
before
the
long
journey
isn
t
it
true
messire
it
s
quite
natural
even
when
a
person
knows
that
happiness
is
waiting
at
the
end
of
the
road
let
him
make
us
laugh
or
i
m
afraid
it
will
end
in
tears
and
everything
will
be
spoiled
before
the
journey
woland
nodded
to
behemoth
who
became
all
animated
jumped
down
from
the
saddle
put
his
fingers
in
his
mouth
puffed
out
his
cheeks
and
whistled
margarita
s
ears
rang
her
horse
reared
in
the
copse
dry
twigs
rained
down
from
the
trees
a
whole
flock
of
crows
and
sparrows
flew
up
a
pillar
of
dust
went
sweeping
down
to
the
river
and
as
an
excursion
boat
was
passing
the
pier
one
could
see
several
of
the
passengers
caps
blow
off
into
the
water
the
whistle
made
the
master
start
yet
he
did
not
turn
but
began
gesticulating
still
more
anxiously
raising
his
hand
to
the
sky
as
if
threatening
the
city
behemoth
gazed
around
proudly
that
was
whistled
i
don
t
argue
koroviev
observed
condescendingly
whistled
indeed
but
to
be
impartial
whistled
rather
middlingly
i
m
not
a
choirmaster
behemoth
replied
with
dignity
puffing
up
and
he
winked
unexpectedly
at
margarita
give
us
a
try
for
old
times
sake
koroviev
said
rubbed
his
hand
and
breathed
on
his
fingers
watch
out
watch
out
came
the
stem
voice
of
woland
on
his
horse
no
inflicting
of
injuries
messire
believe
me
koroviev
responded
placing
his
hand
on
his
heart
in
fun
merely
in
fun
here
he
suddenly
stretched
himself
upwards
as
if
he
were
made
of
rubber
formed
the
fingers
of
his
right
hand
into
some
clever
arrangement
twisted
himself
up
like
a
screw
and
then
suddenly
unwinding
whistled
this
whistle
margarita
did
not
hear
but
she
saw
it
in
the
moment
when
she
together
with
her
fiery
steed
was
thrown
some
twenty
yards
away
an
oak
tree
beside
her
was
torn
up
by
the
roots
and
the
ground
was
covered
with
cracks
all
the
way
to
the
river
a
huge
slab
of
the
bank
together
with
the
pier
and
the
restaurant
sagged
into
the
river
the
water
boiled
shot
up
and
the
entire
excursion
boat
with
its
perfectly
unharmed
passengers
was
washed
on
to
the
low
bank
opposite
a
jackdaw
killed
by
fagott
s
whistle
was
flung
at
the
feet
of
margarita
s
snorting
steed
the
master
was
startled
by
this
whistle
he
clutched
his
head
and
ran
back
to
the
group
of
waiting
companions
well
then
woland
addressed
him
from
the
height
of
his
steed
is
your
farewell
completed
yes
it
s
completed
the
master
replied
and
having
calmed
down
looked
directly
and
boldly
into
woland
s
face
and
then
over
the
hills
like
a
trumpet
blast
rolled
woland
s
terrible
voice
it
s
time
and
with
it
the
sharp
whistle
and
guffaw
of
behemoth
the
steeds
tore
off
and
the
riders
rose
into
the
air
and
galloped
margarita
felt
her
furious
steed
champing
and
straining
at
the
bit
woland
s
cloak
billowed
over
the
heads
of
the
cavalcade
the
cloak
began
to
cover
the
evening
sky
when
the
black
shroud
was
momentarily
blown
aside
margarita
looked
back
as
she
rode
and
saw
that
there
not
only
were
no
multicoloured
towers
behind
them
but
the
city
itself
had
long
been
gone
it
was
asif
it
had
fallen
through
the
earth
only
mist
and
smoke
were
left
chapter
forgiveness
and
eternal
refuge
gods
my
gods
how
sad
the
evening
earth
how
mysterious
the
mists
over
the
swamps
he
who
has
wandered
in
these
mists
he
who
has
suffered
much
before
death
he
who
has
flown
over
this
earth
bearing
on
himself
too
heavy
a
burden
knows
it
the
weary
man
knows
it
and
without
regret
he
leaves
the
mists
of
the
earth
its
swamps
and
rivers
with
a
light
heart
he
gives
himself
into
the
hands
of
death
knowing
that
she
alone
can
bring
him
peace
the
magical
black
horses
also
became
tired
and
carried
their
riders
slowly
and
ineluctable
night
began
to
overtake
them
sensing
it
at
his
back
even
the
irrepressible
behemoth
quieted
down
and
his
claws
sunk
into
the
saddle
flew
silent
and
serious
puffing
up
his
tail
night
began
to
cover
forests
and
fields
with
its
black
shawl
night
lit
melancholy
little
lights
somewhere
far
below
now
no
longer
interesting
and
necessary
either
for
margarita
or
for
the
master
alien
lights
night
was
outdistancing
the
cavalcade
it
sowed
itself
over
them
from
above
casting
white
specks
of
stars
here
and
there
in
the
saddened
sky
night
thickened
flew
alongside
caught
at
the
riders
cloaks
and
tearing
them
from
their
shoulders
exposed
the
deceptions
and
when
margarita
blown
upon
by
the
cool
wind
opened
her
eyes
she
saw
how
the
appearance
of
them
all
was
changing
as
they
flew
to
their
goal
and
when
from
beyond
the
edge
of
the
forest
the
crimson
and
full
moon
began
rising
to
meet
them
all
deceptions
vanished
fell
into
the
swamp
the
unstable
magic
garments
drowned
in
the
mists
hardly
recognizable
as
korovievfagott
the
selfappointed
interpreter
to
the
mysterious
consultant
who
needed
no
interpreting
was
he
who
now
flew
just
beside
woland
to
the
right
of
the
master
s
friend
in
place
of
him
who
had
left
sparrow
hills
in
a
ragged
circus
costume
under
the
name
of
korovievfagott
there
now
rode
softly
clinking
the
golden
chains
of
the
bridle
a
darkviolet
knight
with
a
most
gloomy
and
neversmiling
face
he
rested
his
chin
on
his
chest
he
did
not
look
at
the
moon
he
was
not
interested
in
the
earth
he
was
thinking
something
of
his
own
flying
beside
woland
why
has
he
changed
so
margarita
quietly
asked
woland
to
the
whistling
of
the
wind
this
knight
once
made
an
unfortunate
joke
replied
woland
turning
his
face
with
its
quietly
burning
eye
to
margarita
the
pun
he
thought
up
in
a
discussion
about
light
and
darkness
was
not
altogether
good
and
after
that
the
knight
had
to
go
on
joking
a
bit
more
and
longer
than
he
supposed
but
this
is
one
of
the
nights
when
accounts
are
settled
the
knight
has
paid
up
and
closed
his
account
night
also
tore
off
behemoth
s
fluffy
tail
pulled
off
his
fur
and
scattered
it
in
tufts
over
the
swamps
he
who
had
been
a
cat
entertaining
the
prince
of
darkness
now
turned
out
to
be
a
slim
youth
a
demonpage
the
best
jester
the
world
has
ever
seen
now
he
too
grew
quiet
and
flew
noiselessly
setting
his
young
face
towards
the
light
that
streamed
from
the
moon
at
the
far
side
the
steel
of
his
armour
glittering
flew
azazello
the
moon
also
changed
his
face
the
absurd
ugly
fang
disappeared
without
a
trace
and
the
albugo
on
his
eye
proved
false
azazello
s
eyes
were
both
the
same
empty
and
black
and
his
face
was
white
and
cold
now
azazello
flew
in
his
true
form
as
the
demon
of
the
waterless
desert
the
killerdemon
margarita
could
not
see
herself
but
she
saw
very
well
how
the
master
had
changed
his
hair
was
now
white
in
the
moonlight
and
gathered
behind
in
a
braid
and
it
flew
on
the
wind
when
the
wind
blew
the
cloak
away
from
the
master
s
legs
margarita
saw
the
stars
of
spurs
on
his
jackboots
now
going
out
now
lighting
up
like
the
demonyouth
the
master
flew
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
moon
yet
smiling
to
it
as
to
a
close
and
beloved
friend
and
from
a
habit
acquired
in
room
no
murmuring
something
to
himself
and
finally
woland
also
flew
in
his
true
image
margarita
could
not
have
said
what
his
horse
s
bridle
was
made
of
but
thought
it
might
be
chains
of
moonlight
and
the
horse
itself
was
a
mass
of
darkness
and
the
horse
s
mane
a
storm
cloud
and
the
rider
s
spurs
the
white
flecks
of
stars
thus
they
flew
in
silence
for
a
long
time
until
the
place
itself
began
to
change
below
them
the
melancholy
forests
drowned
in
earthly
darkness
and
drew
with
them
the
dim
blades
of
the
rivers
boulders
appeared
and
began
to
gleam
below
with
black
gaps
between
them
where
the
moonlight
did
not
penetrate
woland
reined
in
his
horse
on
a
stony
joyless
flat
summit
and
the
riders
then
proceeded
at
a
walk
listening
to
the
crunch
of
flint
and
stone
under
the
horses
shoes
moonlight
flooded
the
platform
greenly
and
brightly
and
soon
margarita
made
out
an
armchair
in
this
deserted
place
and
in
it
the
white
figure
of
a
seated
man
possibly
the
seated
man
was
deaf
or
else
too
sunk
in
his
own
thoughts
he
did
not
hear
the
stony
earth
shudder
under
the
horses
weight
and
the
riders
approached
him
without
disturbing
him
the
moon
helped
margarita
well
it
shone
better
than
the
best
electric
lantern
and
margarita
saw
that
the
seated
man
whose
eyes
seemed
blind
rubbed
his
hands
fitfully
and
peered
with
those
same
unseeing
eyes
at
the
disc
of
the
moon
now
margarita
saw
that
beside
the
heavy
stone
chair
on
which
sparks
glittered
in
the
moonlight
lay
a
dark
huge
sharpeared
dog
and
like
its
master
it
gazed
anxiously
at
the
moon
pieces
of
a
broken
jug
were
scattered
by
the
seated
man
s
feet
and
an
undrying
blackred
puddle
spread
there
the
riders
stopped
their
horses
your
novel
has
been
read
woland
began
turning
to
the
master
and
the
only
thing
said
about
it
was
that
unfortunately
it
is
not
finished
so
then
i
wanted
to
show
you
your
hero
for
about
two
thousand
years
he
has
been
sitting
on
this
platform
and
sleeping
but
when
the
full
moon
comes
as
you
see
he
is
tormented
by
insomnia
it
torments
not
only
him
but
also
his
faithful
guardian
the
dog
if
it
is
true
that
cowardice
is
the
most
grievous
vice
then
the
dog
at
least
is
not
guilty
of
it
storms
were
the
only
thing
the
brave
dog
feared
well
he
who
loves
must
share
the
lot
of
the
one
he
loves
what
is
he
saying
asked
margarita
and
her
perfectly
calm
face
clouded
over
with
compassion
he
says
one
and
the
same
thing
woland
replied
he
says
that
even
the
moon
gives
him
no
peace
and
that
his
is
a
bad
job
that
is
what
he
always
says
when
he
is
not
asleep
and
when
he
sleeps
he
dreams
one
and
the
same
thing
there
is
a
path
of
moonlight
and
he
wants
to
walk
down
it
and
talk
with
the
prisoner
hanozri
because
as
he
insists
he
never
finished
what
he
was
saying
that
time
long
ago
on
the
fourteenth
day
of
the
spring
month
of
nisan
but
alas
for
some
reason
he
never
manages
to
get
on
to
this
path
and
no
one
comes
to
him
then
there
s
no
help
for
it
he
must
talk
to
himself
however
one
does
need
some
diversity
and
to
his
talk
about
the
moon
he
often
adds
that
of
all
things
in
the
world
he
most
hates
his
immortality
and
his
unheardof
fame
he
maintains
that
he
would
willingly
exchange
his
lot
for
that
of
the
ragged
tramp
matthew
levi
twelve
thousand
moons
for
one
moon
long
ago
isn
t
that
too
much
asked
margarita
repeating
the
story
with
frieda
said
woland
but
don
t
trouble
yourself
here
margarita
everything
will
turn
out
right
the
world
is
built
on
that
let
him
go
margarita
suddenly
cried
piercingly
as
she
had
cried
once
as
a
witch
and
at
this
cry
a
stone
fell
somewhere
in
the
mountains
and
tumbled
down
the
ledges
into
the
abyss
filling
the
mountains
with
rumbling
but
margarita
could
not
have
said
whether
it
was
the
rumbling
of
its
fallor
the
rumbling
of
satanic
laughter
in
any
case
woland
was
laughing
as
he
glanced
at
margarita
and
said
don
t
shout
in
the
mountains
he
s
accustomed
to
avalanches
anyway
and
it
won
t
rouse
him
you
don
t
need
to
ask
for
him
margarita
because
the
one
he
so
yearns
to
talk
with
has
already
asked
for
him
here
woland
turned
to
the
master
and
said
well
now
you
can
finish
your
novel
with
one
phrase
the
master
seemed
to
have
been
expecting
this
as
he
stood
motionless
and
looked
at
the
seated
procurator
he
cupped
his
hands
to
his
mouth
and
cried
out
so
that
the
echo
leaped
over
the
unpeopled
and
unforested
mountains
you
re
free
you
re
free
he
s
waiting
for
you
the
mountains
turned
the
master
s
voice
to
thunder
and
by
this
same
thunder
they
were
destroyed
the
accursed
rocky
walls
collapsed
only
the
platform
with
the
stone
armchair
remained
over
the
black
abyss
into
which
the
walls
had
gone
a
boundless
city
lit
up
dominated
by
gleaming
idols
above
a
garden
grown
luxuriously
overmany
thousands
of
moons
the
path
of
moonlight
so
long
awaited
by
the
procurator
stretched
right
to
this
garden
and
the
first
to
rush
down
it
was
the
sharpeared
dog
the
man
in
the
white
cloak
with
bloodred
lining
rose
from
the
armchair
and
shouted
something
in
a
hoarse
cracked
voice
it
was
impossible
to
tell
whether
he
was
weeping
or
laughing
or
what
he
shouted
it
could
only
be
seen
that
following
his
faithful
guardian
he
too
rushed
headlong
down
the
path
of
moonlight
i
m
to
follow
him
there
the
master
asked
anxiously
holding
the
bridle
no
replied
woland
why
run
after
what
is
already
finished
there
then
the
master
asked
turning
and
pointing
back
where
the
recently
abandoned
city
with
the
gingerbread
towers
of
its
convent
with
the
sun
broken
to
smithereens
in
its
windows
now
wove
itself
behind
them
not
there
either
replied
woland
and
his
voice
thickened
and
flowed
over
the
rocks
romantic
master
he
whom
the
hero
you
invented
and
have
just
set
free
so
yearns
to
see
has
read
your
novel
here
woland
turned
to
margarita
margarita
nikolaevna
it
is
impossible
not
to
believe
that
you
have
tried
to
think
up
the
best
future
for
the
master
but
really
what
i
am
offering
you
and
what
yeshua
has
asked
for
you
is
better
still
leave
them
to
each
other
woland
said
leaning
towards
the
master
s
saddle
from
his
own
pointing
to
where
the
procurator
had
gone
let
s
not
interfere
with
them
and
maybe
they
ll
still
arrive
at
something
here
woland
waved
his
arm
in
the
direction
of
yershalaim
and
it
went
out
and
there
too
woland
pointed
behind
them
what
are
you
going
to
do
in
the
little
basement
here
the
sun
broken
up
in
the
glass
went
out
why
woland
went
on
persuasively
and
gently
oh
thriceromantic
master
can
it
be
that
you
don
t
want
to
go
strolling
with
your
friend
in
the
daytime
under
cherry
trees
just
coming
into
bloom
and
in
the
evening
listen
to
schubert
s
music
can
it
be
that
you
won
t
like
writing
with
a
goose
quill
by
candlelight
can
it
be
that
you
don
t
want
to
sit
over
a
retort
like
faust
in
hopes
that
you
ll
succeed
in
forming
a
new
homunculus
there
there
the
house
and
the
old
servant
are
already
waiting
for
you
the
candles
are
already
burning
and
soon
they
will
go
out
because
you
will
immediately
meet
the
dawn
down
this
path
master
this
one
farewell
it
s
time
for
me
to
go
farewell
margarita
and
the
master
answered
woland
in
one
cry
then
the
black
woland
heedless
of
any
road
threw
himself
into
a
gap
and
his
retinue
noisily
hurtled
down
after
him
there
were
no
rocks
no
platform
no
path
of
moonlight
no
yershalaim
around
the
black
steeds
also
vanished
the
master
and
margarita
saw
the
promised
dawn
it
began
straight
away
immediately
after
the
midnight
moon
the
master
walked
with
his
friend
in
the
brilliance
of
the
first
rays
of
morning
over
a
mossy
little
stone
bridge
they
crossed
it
the
faithful
lovers
left
the
stream
behind
and
walked
down
the
sandy
path
listen
to
the
stillness
margarita
said
to
the
master
and
the
sand
rustled
under
her
bare
feet
listen
and
enjoy
what
you
were
not
given
in
life
peace
look
there
ahead
is
your
eternal
home
which
you
have
been
given
as
a
reward
i
can
already
see
the
venetian
window
and
the
twistingvine
it
climbs
right
up
to
the
roof
here
is
your
home
your
eternal
home
i
know
that
in
the
evenings
you
will
be
visited
by
those
you
love
those
who
interest
you
and
who
will
never
trouble
you
they
will
play
for
you
they
will
sing
for
you
you
will
see
what
light
is
in
the
room
when
the
candles
are
burning
you
will
fall
asleep
having
put
on
your
greasy
and
eternal
nightcap
you
will
fall
asleep
with
a
smile
on
your
lips
sleep
will
strengthen
you
you
will
reason
wisely
and
you
will
no
longer
be
able
to
drive
me
away
i
will
watch
over
your
sleep
thus
spoke
margarita
walking
with
the
master
to
their
eternal
home
and
it
seemed
to
the
master
that
margarita
s
words
flowed
in
the
same
way
as
the
stream
they
had
left
behind
flowed
and
whispered
and
the
master
s
memory
the
master
s
anxious
needled
memory
began
to
fade
someone
was
setting
the
master
free
as
he
himself
had
just
set
free
the
hero
he
had
created
this
hero
had
gone
into
the
abyss
gone
irrevocably
the
son
of
the
astrologerking
forgiven
on
the
eve
of
sunday
the
cruel
fifth
procurator
of
judea
the
equestrian
pontius
pilate
epilogue
but
all
the
same
what
happened
later
in
moscow
after
that
saturday
evening
when
woland
left
the
capital
having
disappeared
from
sparrow
hills
at
sunset
with
his
retinue
of
the
fact
that
for
a
long
time
a
dense
hum
of
the
most
incredible
rumours
went
all
over
the
capital
and
very
quickly
spread
to
remote
and
forsaken
provincial
places
as
well
nothing
need
be
said
it
is
even
nauseating
to
repeat
such
rumours
the
writer
of
these
truthful
lines
himself
personally
on
a
trip
to
feodosiya
heard
a
story
on
the
train
about
two
thousand
persons
in
moscow
coming
out
of
a
theatre
starknaked
in
the
literal
sense
of
the
word
and
in
that
fashion
returning
home
in
taxicabs
the
whisper
unclean
powers
was
heard
in
queues
waiting
at
dairy
stores
in
tramcars
shops
apartments
kitchens
on
trains
both
suburban
and
longdistance
in
stations
big
and
small
at
summer
resorts
and
on
beaches
the
most
developed
and
cultured
people
to
be
sure
took
no
part
in
this
taletelling
about
the
unclean
powers
that
had
visited
moscow
even
laughed
at
them
and
tried
to
bring
the
tellers
to
reason
but
all
the
same
a
fact
as
they
say
is
a
fact
and
to
brush
it
aside
without
explanations
is
simply
impossible
someone
had
visited
the
capital
the
nice
little
cinders
left
over
from
griboedov
s
and
many
other
things
as
well
confirmed
that
only
too
eloquently
cultured
people
adopted
the
view
of
the
investigation
it
had
been
the
work
of
a
gang
of
hypnotists
and
ventriloquists
with
a
superb
command
of
their
art
measures
for
catching
them
in
moscow
as
well
as
outside
it
were
of
course
immediately
and
energetically
taken
but
most
regrettably
produced
no
results
the
one
calling
himself
woland
disappeared
with
all
his
company
and
neither
returned
to
moscow
nor
appeared
anywhere
else
and
did
not
manifest
himself
in
any
way
quite
naturally
the
suggestion
emerged
that
he
had
fled
abroad
but
there
too
he
gave
no
signs
of
himself
the
investigation
of
his
case
continued
for
a
long
time
because
in
truth
it
was
a
monstrous
case
not
to
mention
four
burneddown
buildings
and
hundreds
of
people
driven
mad
there
had
been
murders
of
two
this
could
be
said
with
certainty
of
berlioz
and
of
that
illfated
employee
of
the
bureau
for
acquainting
foreigners
with
places
of
interest
in
moscow
the
former
baron
meigel
they
had
been
murdered
the
charred
bones
of
the
latter
were
discovered
in
apartment
no
on
sadovaya
street
after
the
fire
was
put
out
yes
there
were
victims
and
these
victims
called
for
investigation
but
there
were
other
victims
as
well
even
after
woland
left
the
capital
and
these
victims
sadly
enough
were
black
cats
approximately
a
hundred
of
these
peaceful
and
useful
animals
devoted
to
mankind
were
shot
or
otherwise
exterminated
in
various
parts
of
the
country
about
a
dozen
cats
some
badly
disfigured
were
delivered
to
police
stations
in
various
cities
for
instance
in
armavir
one
of
these
perfectly
guiltless
beasts
was
brought
to
the
police
by
some
citizen
with
its
front
paws
tied
this
cat
had
been
ambushed
by
the
citizen
at
the
very
moment
when
the
animal
with
a
thievish
look
how
can
it
be
helped
if
cats
have
this
look
it
is
not
because
they
are
depraved
but
because
they
are
afraid
lest
some
beings
stronger
than
themselves
dogs
or
people
cause
them
some
harm
or
offence
both
are
very
easy
to
do
but
i
assure
you
there
is
no
credit
in
doing
so
no
none
at
all
so
then
with
a
thievish
look
the
cat
was
for
some
reason
about
to
dash
into
the
burdock
falling
upon
the
cat
and
tearing
his
necktie
off
to
bind
it
the
citizen
muttered
venomously
and
threateningly
aha
so
now
you
ve
been
so
good
as
to
come
to
our
armavir
mister
hypnotist
well
we
re
not
afraid
of
you
here
don
t
pretend
to
be
dumb
we
know
what
kind
of
goose
you
are
the
citizen
brought
the
cat
to
the
police
dragging
the
poor
beast
by
its
front
paws
bound
with
a
green
necktie
giving
it
little
kicks
to
make
the
cat
walk
not
otherwise
than
on
its
hind
legs
you
quit
that
cried
the
citizen
accompanied
by
whistling
boys
quit
playing
the
fool
it
won
t
do
kindly
walk
like
everybody
else
the
black
cat
only
rolled
its
martyred
eyes
being
deprived
by
nature
of
the
gift
of
speech
it
could
not
vindicate
itself
in
any
way
the
poor
beast
owed
its
salvation
first
of
all
to
the
police
and
then
to
its
owner
a
venerable
old
widow
as
soon
as
the
cat
was
delivered
to
the
police
station
it
was
realized
that
the
citizen
smelled
rather
strongly
of
alcohol
as
a
result
of
which
his
evidence
was
at
once
subject
to
doubt
and
the
little
old
lady
having
meanwhile
learned
from
neighbours
that
her
cat
had
been
hauled
in
rushed
to
the
station
and
arrived
in
the
nick
of
time
she
gave
the
most
flattering
references
for
the
cat
explained
that
she
had
known
it
for
five
years
since
it
was
a
kitten
that
she
vouched
for
it
as
for
her
own
self
and
proved
that
it
had
never
been
known
to
do
anything
bad
and
had
never
been
to
moscow
as
it
had
been
born
in
armavir
so
there
it
had
grown
up
and
learned
the
catching
of
mice
the
cat
was
untied
and
returned
to
its
owner
having
tasted
grief
it
s
true
and
having
learned
by
experience
the
meaning
of
error
and
slander
besides
cats
some
minor
unpleasantnesses
befell
certain
persons
detained
for
a
short
time
were
in
leningrad
the
citizens
wolman
and
wolper
in
saratov
kiev
and
kharkov
three
volodins
in
kazan
one
volokh
and
in
penza
this
for
totally
unknown
reasons
doctor
of
chemical
sciences
vetchinkevich
true
he
was
enormously
tall
very
swarthy
and
darkhaired
in
various
places
besides
that
nine
korovins
four
korovkins
and
two
karavaevs
were
caught
a
certain
citizen
was
taken
off
the
sebastopol
train
and
bound
at
the
belgorod
station
this
citizen
had
decided
to
entertain
his
fellow
passengers
with
card
tricks
in
yaroslavl
a
citizen
came
to
a
restaurant
at
lunchtime
carrying
a
primus
which
he
had
just
picked
up
from
being
repaired
the
moment
they
saw
him
the
two
doormen
abandoned
their
posts
in
the
coatroom
and
fled
and
after
them
fled
all
the
restaurant
s
customers
and
personnel
with
that
in
some
inexplicable
fashion
the
girl
at
the
cash
register
had
all
the
money
disappear
on
her
there
was
much
else
but
one
cannot
remember
everything
again
and
again
justice
must
be
done
to
the
investigation
every
attempt
was
made
not
only
to
catch
the
criminals
but
to
explain
all
their
mischief
and
it
all
was
explained
and
these
explanations
cannot
but
be
acknowledged
as
sensible
and
irrefutable
representatives
of
the
investigation
and
experienced
psychiatrists
established
that
members
of
the
criminal
gang
or
one
of
them
perhaps
suspicion
fell
mainly
on
koroviev
were
hypnotists
of
unprecedented
power
who
could
show
themselves
not
in
the
place
where
they
actually
were
but
in
imaginary
shifted
positions
along
with
that
they
could
freely
suggest
to
those
they
encountered
that
certain
things
or
people
were
where
they
actually
were
not
and
contrariwise
could
remove
from
the
field
of
vision
things
or
people
that
were
in
fact
to
be
found
within
that
field
of
vision
in
the
light
of
such
explanations
decidedly
everything
was
clear
even
what
the
citizens
found
most
troublesome
the
apparently
quite
inexplicable
invulnerability
of
the
cat
shot
at
in
apartment
no
during
the
attempt
to
put
him
under
arrest
there
had
been
no
cat
on
the
chandelier
naturally
nor
had
anyone
even
thought
of
returning
their
fire
the
shooters
had
been
aiming
at
an
empty
spot
while
koroviev
having
suggested
that
the
cat
was
acting
up
on
the
chandelier
was
free
to
stand
behind
the
shooters
backs
mugging
and
enjoying
his
enormous
albeit
criminally
employed
capacity
for
suggestion
it
was
he
of
course
who
had
set
fire
to
the
apartment
by
spilling
the
benzene
styopa
likhodeev
had
of
course
never
gone
to
any
yalta
such
a
stunt
was
beyond
even
koroviev
s
powers
nor
had
he
sent
any
telegrams
from
there
after
fainting
in
the
jeweller
s
wife
s
apartment
frightened
by
a
trick
of
koroviev
s
who
had
shown
him
a
cat
holding
a
pickled
mushroom
on
a
fork
he
lay
there
until
koroviev
jeering
at
him
capped
him
with
a
shaggy
felt
hat
and
senthim
to
the
moscow
airport
having
first
suggested
to
the
representatives
of
the
investigation
who
went
to
meet
styopa
that
styopa
would
be
getting
off
the
plane
from
sebastopol
true
the
criminal
investigation
department
in
yalta
maintained
that
they
had
received
the
barefoot
styopa
and
had
sent
telegrams
concerning
styopa
to
moscow
but
no
copies
of
these
telegrams
were
found
in
the
files
from
which
the
sad
but
absolutely
invincible
conclusion
was
drawn
that
the
hypnotizing
gang
was
able
to
hypnotize
at
an
enormous
distance
and
not
only
individual
persons
but
even
whole
groups
of
them
under
these
circumstances
the
criminals
were
able
to
drive
people
of
the
most
sturdy
psychic
makeup
out
of
their
minds
to
say
nothing
of
such
trifles
as
the
pack
of
cards
in
the
pocket
of
someone
in
the
stalls
the
women
s
disappearing
dresses
or
the
miaowing
beret
or
other
things
of
that
sort
such
stunts
can
be
pulled
by
any
professional
hypnotist
of
average
ability
on
any
stage
including
the
uncomplicated
trick
of
tearing
the
head
off
the
master
of
ceremonies
the
talking
cat
was
also
sheer
nonsense
to
present
people
with
such
a
cat
it
is
enough
to
have
a
command
of
the
basic
principles
of
ventriloquism
and
scarcely
anyone
will
doubt
that
koroviev
s
art
went
significantly
beyond
those
principles
yes
the
point
here
lay
not
at
all
in
packs
of
cards
or
the
false
letters
in
nikanor
ivanovich
s
briefcase
these
were
all
trifles
it
was
he
koroviev
who
had
sent
berlioz
to
certain
death
under
the
tramcar
it
was
he
who
had
driven
the
poor
poet
ivan
homeless
crazy
he
who
had
made
him
have
visions
see
ancient
yershalaim
in
tormenting
dreams
and
sunscorched
waterless
bald
mountainwith
three
men
hanging
on
posts
it
was
he
and
his
gang
who
had
made
margarita
nikolaevna
and
her
housekeeper
natasha
disappear
from
moscow
incidentally
the
investigation
considered
this
matter
with
special
attention
it
had
to
find
out
if
the
two
women
had
been
abducted
by
the
gang
of
murderers
and
arsonists
or
had
fled
voluntarily
with
the
criminal
company
on
the
basis
of
the
absurd
and
incoherent
evidence
of
nikolai
ivanovich
and
considering
the
strange
and
insane
note
margarita
nikolaevna
had
left
for
her
husband
the
note
in
which
she
wrote
that
she
had
gone
off
to
become
a
witch
aswell
as
the
circumstance
that
natasha
had
disappeared
leaving
all
her
clothes
behind
the
investigation
concluded
that
both
mistress
and
housekeeper
like
many
others
had
been
hypnotized
and
had
thus
been
abducted
by
the
band
there
also
emerged
the
probably
quite
correct
thought
that
the
criminals
had
been
attracted
by
the
beauty
of
the
two
women
yet
what
remained
completely
unclear
to
the
investigation
was
the
gang
s
motive
in
abducting
the
mental
patient
who
called
himself
the
master
from
the
psychiatric
clinic
this
they
never
succeeded
in
establishing
nor
did
they
succeed
in
obtaining
the
abducted
man
s
last
name
thus
he
vanished
for
ever
under
the
dead
alias
of
number
oneeighteen
from
the
first
building
and
so
almost
everything
was
explained
and
the
investigation
came
to
an
end
as
everything
generally
comes
to
an
end
several
years
passed
and
the
citizens
began
to
forget
woland
koroviev
and
the
rest
many
changes
took
place
in
the
lives
of
those
who
suffered
from
woland
and
his
company
and
however
trifling
and
insignificant
those
changes
are
they
still
ought
to
be
noted
georges
bengalsky
for
instance
after
spending
three
months
in
the
clinic
recovered
and
left
it
but
had
to
give
up
his
work
at
the
variety
and
that
at
the
hottest
time
when
the
public
was
flocking
after
tickets
the
memory
of
black
magic
and
its
exposure
proved
very
tenacious
bengalsky
left
the
variety
for
he
understood
that
to
appear
every
night
before
two
thousand
people
to
be
inevitably
recognized
and
endlessly
subjected
to
jeering
questions
of
how
he
liked
it
better
with
or
without
his
head
was
much
too
painful
and
besides
that
the
master
of
ceremonies
had
lost
a
considerable
dose
of
his
gaiety
which
is
so
necessary
in
his
profession
he
remained
with
the
unpleasant
burdensome
habit
of
falling
every
spring
during
the
full
moon
into
a
state
of
anxiety
suddenly
clutching
his
neck
looking
around
fearfully
and
weeping
these
fits
would
pass
but
all
the
same
since
he
had
them
he
could
not
continue
in
his
former
occupation
and
so
the
master
of
ceremonies
retired
and
started
living
on
his
savings
which
by
his
modest
reckoning
were
enough
to
last
him
fifteen
years
he
left
and
never
again
met
varenukha
who
has
gained
universal
popularity
and
affection
by
his
responsiveness
and
politeness
incredible
even
among
theatre
administrators
the
freepass
seekers
for
instance
never
refer
to
him
otherwise
than
as
fatherbenefactor
one
can
call
the
variety
at
any
time
and
always
hear
in
the
receiver
a
soft
but
sad
voice
may
i
help
you
and
to
the
request
that
varenukha
be
called
to
the
phone
the
same
voice
hastens
to
answer
at
your
service
and
oh
how
ivan
savelyevich
has
suffered
from
his
own
politeness
styopa
likhodeev
was
to
talk
no
more
over
the
phone
at
the
variety
immediately
after
his
release
from
the
clinic
where
he
spent
eight
days
styopa
was
transferred
to
rostov
taking
up
the
position
of
manager
of
a
large
food
store
rumour
has
it
that
he
has
stopped
drinking
cheap
wine
altogether
and
drinks
only
vodka
with
blackcurrant
buds
which
has
greatly
improved
his
health
they
say
he
has
become
taciturn
and
keeps
away
from
women
the
removal
of
stepan
bogdanovich
from
the
variety
did
not
bring
rimsky
the
joy
of
which
he
had
been
so
greedily
dreaming
over
the
past
several
years
after
the
clinic
and
kislovodsk
old
old
as
could
be
his
head
wagging
the
findirector
submitted
a
request
to
be
dismissed
from
the
variety
the
interesting
thing
was
that
this
request
was
brought
to
the
variety
by
rimsky
s
wife
grigory
danilovich
himself
found
it
beyond
his
strength
to
visit
even
during
the
daytime
the
building
where
he
had
seen
the
cracked
windowpane
flooded
with
moonlight
and
the
long
arm
making
its
way
to
the
lower
latch
having
left
the
variety
the
findirector
took
a
job
with
a
children
s
marionette
theatre
in
zamoskvorechye
in
this
theatre
he
no
longer
had
to
run
into
the
much
esteemed
arkady
apollonovich
sempleyarov
on
matters
of
acoustics
the
latter
had
been
promptly
transferred
to
briansk
and
appointed
manager
of
a
mushroom
cannery
the
muscovites
now
eat
salted
and
pickled
mushrooms
and
cannot
praise
them
enough
and
they
rejoice
exceedingly
over
this
transfer
since
it
is
a
bygone
thing
we
may
now
say
that
arkady
apollonovich
s
relations
with
acoustics
never
worked
out
very
well
and
as
they
had
been
so
they
remained
no
matter
how
he
tried
to
improve
them
among
persons
who
have
broken
with
the
theatre
apart
from
arkady
apollonovich
mention
should
be
made
of
nikanor
ivanovich
bosoy
though
he
had
been
connected
with
the
theatre
in
no
other
way
than
by
his
love
for
free
tickets
nikanor
ivanovich
not
only
goes
to
no
sort
of
theatre
either
paying
or
free
but
even
changes
countenance
at
any
theatrical
conversation
besides
the
theatre
he
has
come
to
hate
not
to
a
lesser
but
to
a
still
greater
degree
the
poet
pushkin
and
the
talented
actor
sawa
potapovich
kurolesov
the
latter
to
such
a
degree
that
last
year
seeing
a
blackframed
announcement
in
the
newspaper
that
sawa
potapovich
had
suffered
a
stroke
in
the
full
bloom
of
his
career
nikanor
ivanovich
turned
so
purple
that
he
almost
followed
after
sawa
potapovich
and
bellowed
serves
him
right
moreover
that
same
evening
nikanor
ivanovich
in
whom
the
death
of
the
popular
actor
had
evoked
a
great
many
painful
memories
alone
in
the
sole
company
of
the
full
moon
shining
on
sadovaya
got
terribly
drunk
and
with
each
drink
the
cursed
line
of
hateful
figures
got
longer
and
in
this
line
were
dunchil
sergei
gerardovich
and
the
beautiful
ida
herculanovna
and
that
redhaired
owner
of
fighting
geese
and
the
candid
kanavkin
nikolai
well
and
what
on
earth
happened
to
them
good
heavens
precisely
nothing
happened
to
them
or
could
happen
since
they
never
actually
existed
as
that
affable
artiste
the
master
of
ceremonies
never
existed
nor
the
theatre
itself
nor
that
old
pinchfist
of
an
aunt
porokhovnikova
who
kept
currency
rotting
in
the
cellar
and
there
certainly
were
no
golden
trumpets
or
impudent
cooks
all
this
nikanor
ivanovich
merely
dreamed
under
the
influence
of
the
nasty
koroviev
the
only
living
person
to
fly
into
this
dream
was
precisely
savva
potapovich
the
actor
and
he
got
mixed
up
in
it
only
because
he
was
ingrained
in
nikanor
ivanovich
s
memory
owing
to
his
frequent
performances
on
the
radio
he
existed
but
the
rest
did
not
so
maybe
aloisy
mogarych
did
not
exist
either
oh
no
he
not
only
existed
but
he
exists
even
now
and
precisely
in
the
post
given
up
by
rimsky
that
is
the
post
of
findirector
of
the
variety
coming
to
his
senses
about
twentyfour
hours
after
his
visit
to
woland
on
a
train
somewhere
near
vyatka
aloisy
realized
that
having
for
some
reason
left
moscow
in
a
darkened
state
of
mind
he
had
forgotten
to
put
on
his
trousers
but
instead
had
stolen
with
an
unknown
purpose
the
completely
useless
household
register
of
the
builder
paying
a
colossal
sum
of
money
to
the
conductor
aloisy
acquired
from
him
an
old
and
greasy
pair
of
pants
and
in
vyatka
he
turned
back
but
alas
he
did
not
find
the
builder
s
little
house
the
decrepit
trash
had
been
licked
clean
away
by
a
fire
but
aloisy
was
an
extremely
enterprising
man
two
weeks
later
he
was
living
in
a
splendid
room
on
briusovsky
lane
and
a
few
months
later
he
was
sitting
in
rimsky
s
office
and
as
rimsky
had
once
suffered
because
of
styopa
so
now
varenukha
was
tormented
because
of
aloisy
ivan
savelyevich
s
only
dream
is
that
this
aloisy
should
be
removed
somewhere
out
of
sight
because
as
varenukha
sometimes
whispers
in
intimate
company
he
supposedly
has
never
in
his
life
met
such
scum
as
this
aloisy
and
he
supposedly
expects
anything
you
like
from
this
aloisy
however
the
administrator
is
perhaps
prejudiced
aloisy
has
not
been
known
for
any
shady
business
or
for
any
business
at
all
unless
of
course
we
count
his
appointing
someone
else
to
replace
the
barman
sokov
for
andrei
fokich
died
of
liver
cancer
in
the
clinic
of
the
first
msu
some
ten
months
after
woland
s
appearance
in
moscow
yes
several
years
have
passed
and
the
events
truthfully
described
in
this
book
have
healed
over
and
faded
from
memory
but
not
for
everyone
not
for
everyone
each
year
with
the
festal
spring
full
moon
a
man
of
about
thirty
or
thirtyodd
appears
towards
evening
under
the
lindens
at
the
patriarch
s
ponds
a
reddishhaired
greeneyed
modestly
dressed
man
he
is
a
researcher
at
the
institute
of
history
and
philosophy
professor
ivan
nikolaevich
ponyrev
coming
under
the
lindens
he
always
sits
down
on
the
same
bench
on
which
he
sat
that
evening
when
berlioz
long
forgotten
by
all
saw
the
moon
breaking
to
pieces
for
the
last
time
in
his
life
whole
now
white
at
the
start
of
the
evening
then
gold
with
a
dark
horsedragon
it
floats
over
the
former
poet
ivan
nikolaevich
and
at
the
same
time
stays
in
place
at
its
height
ivan
nikolaevich
is
aware
of
everything
he
knows
and
understands
everything
he
knows
that
as
a
young
man
he
fell
victim
to
criminal
hypnotists
and
was
afterwards
treated
and
cured
but
he
also
knows
that
there
are
things
he
cannot
manage
he
cannot
manage
this
spring
full
moon
as
soon
as
it
begins
to
approach
as
soon
as
the
luminary
that
once
hung
higher
than
the
two
fivebranched
candlesticks
begins
to
swell
and
fill
with
gold
ivan
nikolaevich
becomes
anxious
nervous
he
loses
appetite
and
sleep
waiting
till
the
moon
ripens
and
when
the
full
moon
comes
nothing
can
keep
ivan
nikolaevich
at
home
towards
evening
he
goes
out
and
walks
to
the
patriarch
s
ponds
sitting
on
the
bench
ivan
nikolaevich
openly
talks
to
himself
smokes
squints
now
at
the
moon
now
at
the
memorable
turnstile
ivan
nikolaevich
spends
an
hour
or
two
like
this
then
he
leaves
his
place
and
always
following
the
same
itinerary
goes
with
empty
and
unseeing
eyes
through
spiridonovka
to
the
lanes
of
the
arbat
he
passes
the
kerosene
shop
turns
by
a
lopsided
old
gaslight
and
steals
up
to
a
fence
behind
which
he
sees
a
luxuriant
though
as
yet
unclothed
garden
and
in
it
a
gothic
mansion
moonwashed
on
the
side
with
the
triple
bay
window
and
dark
on
the
other
the
professor
does
not
know
what
draws
him
to
the
fence
or
who
lives
in
the
mansion
but
he
does
know
that
there
is
no
fighting
with
himself
on
the
night
of
the
full
moon
besides
he
knows
that
he
will
inevitably
see
one
and
the
same
thing
in
the
garden
behind
the
fence
he
will
see
an
elderly
and
respectable
man
with
a
little
beard
wearing
a
pincenez
and
with
slightly
piggish
features
sitting
on
a
bench
ivan
nikolaevich
always
finds
this
resident
of
the
mansion
in
one
and
the
same
dreamy
pose
his
eyes
turned
towards
the
moon
it
is
known
to
ivan
nikolaevich
that
after
admiring
the
moon
the
seated
man
will
unfailingly
turn
his
gaze
to
the
bay
windows
and
fix
it
on
them
as
if
expecting
that
they
would
presently
be
flung
open
and
something
extraordinary
would
appear
on
the
windowsill
the
whole
sequel
ivan
nikolaevich
knows
by
heart
here
he
must
bury
himself
deeper
behind
the
fence
for
presently
the
seated
man
will
begin
to
turn
his
head
restlessly
to
snatch
at
something
in
the
air
with
a
wandering
gaze
to
smile
rapturously
and
then
he
will
suddenly
clasp
his
hands
in
a
sort
of
sweet
anguish
and
then
he
will
murmur
simply
and
rather
loudly
venus
venus
ah
fool
that
i
am
gods
gods
ivan
nikolaevich
will
begin
to
whisper
hiding
behind
the
fence
and
never
taking
his
kindling
eyes
off
the
mysterious
stranger
here
is
one
more
of
the
moon
s
victims
yes
one
more
victim
like
me
and
the
seated
man
will
go
on
talking
ah
fool
that
i
am
why
why
didn
t
i
fly
off
with
her
what
were
you
afraid
of
old
ass
got
yourself
a
certificate
ah
suffer
now
you
old
cretin
it
will
go
on
like
this
until
a
window
in
the
dark
part
of
the
mansion
bangs
something
whitish
appears
in
it
and
an
unpleasant
female
voice
rings
out
nikolai
ivanovich
where
are
you
what
is
this
fantasy
want
to
catch
malaria
come
and
have
tea
here
of
course
the
seated
man
will
recover
his
senses
and
reply
in
a
lying
voice
i
wanted
a
breath
of
air
a
breath
of
air
dearest
the
air
is
so
nice
and
here
he
will
get
up
from
the
bench
shake
his
fist
on
the
sly
at
the
closing
groundfloor
window
and
trudge
back
to
the
house
lying
he
s
lying
oh
gods
how
he
s
lying
ivan
nikolaevich
mutters
as
he
leaves
the
fence
it
s
not
the
air
that
draws
him
to
the
garden
he
sees
something
at
the
time
of
this
spring
full
moon
in
the
garden
up
there
ah
i
d
pay
dearly
to
penetrate
his
mystery
to
know
who
this
venus
is
that
he
s
lost
and
now
fruitlessly
feels
for
in
the
air
trying
to
catch
her
and
the
professor
returns
home
completely
ill
his
wife
pretends
not
to
notice
his
condition
and
urges
him
to
go
to
bed
but
she
herself
does
not
go
to
bed
and
sits
by
the
lamp
with
a
book
looking
with
grieving
eyes
at
the
sleeper
she
knows
that
ivan
nikolaevich
will
wake
up
at
dawn
with
a
painful
cry
will
begin
to
weep
and
thrash
therefore
there
lies
before
her
prepared
ahead
of
time
on
the
tablecloth
under
the
lamp
a
syringe
in
alcohol
and
an
ampoule
of
liquid
the
colour
of
dark
tea
the
poor
woman
tied
to
a
gravely
ill
man
is
now
free
and
can
sleep
without
apprehensions
after
the
injection
ivan
nikolaevich
will
sleep
till
morning
with
a
blissful
face
having
sublime
and
blissful
dreams
unknown
to
her
it
is
always
one
and
the
same
thing
that
awakens
the
scholar
and
draws
pitiful
cries
from
him
on
the
night
of
the
full
moon
he
sees
some
unnatural
noseless
executioner
who
leaping
up
and
hooting
somehow
with
his
voice
sticks
his
spear
into
the
heart
of
gestas
who
is
tied
to
a
post
and
has
gone
insane
but
it
is
not
the
executioner
who
is
frightening
so
much
as
the
unnatural
lighting
in
this
dream
caused
by
some
dark
cloud
boiling
and
heaving
itself
upon
the
earth
as
happens
only
during
world
catastrophes
after
the
injection
everything
changes
before
the
sleeping
man
a
broad
path
of
moonlight
stretches
from
his
bed
to
the
window
and
a
man
in
a
white
cloak
with
bloodred
lining
gets
on
to
this
path
and
begins
to
walk
towards
the
moon
beside
him
walks
a
young
man
in
a
torn
chiton
and
with
a
disfigured
face
the
walkers
talk
heatedly
about
something
they
argue
they
want
to
reach
some
understanding
gods
gods
says
that
man
in
the
cloak
turning
his
haughty
face
to
his
companion
such
a
banal
execution
but
please
here
the
face
turns
from
haughty
to
imploring
tell
me
it
never
happened
i
implore
you
tell
me
it
never
happened
well
of
course
it
never
happened
his
companion
replies
in
a
hoarse
voice
you
imagined
it
and
you
can
swear
it
to
me
the
man
in
the
cloak
asks
ingratiatingly
i
swear
it
replies
his
companion
and
his
eyes
smile
for
some
reason
i
need
nothing
more
the
man
in
the
cloak
exclaims
in
a
husky
voice
and
goes
ever
higher
towards
the
moon
drawing
his
companion
along
behind
them
a
gigantic
sharpeared
dog
walks
calmly
and
majestically
then
the
moonbeam
boils
up
a
river
of
moonlight
begins
to
gush
from
it
and
pours
out
in
all
directions
the
moon
rules
and
plays
the
moon
dances
and
frolics
then
a
woman
of
boundless
beauty
forms
herself
in
the
stream
and
by
the
hand
she
leads
out
to
ivan
a
man
overgrown
with
beard
who
glances
around
fearfully
ivan
nikolaevich
recognizes
him
at
once
it
is
number
oneeighteen
his
nocturnal
guest
in
his
dream
ivan
nikolaevich
reaches
his
arms
out
to
him
and
asks
greedily
so
it
ended
with
that
it
ended
with
that
my
disciple
answers
number
oneeighteen
and
then
the
woman
comes
up
to
ivan
and
says
of
course
with
that
everything
has
ended
and
everything
ends
and
i
will
kiss
you
on
the
forehead
and
everything
with
you
will
be
as
it
should
be
she
bends
over
ivan
and
kisses
him
on
the
forehead
and
ivan
reaches
out
to
her
and
peers
into
her
eyes
but
she
retreats
retreats
and
together
with
her
companion
goes
towards
the
moon
then
the
moon
begins
to
rage
it
pours
streams
of
light
down
right
on
ivan
it
sprays
light
in
all
directions
a
flood
of
moonlight
engulfs
the
room
the
light
heaves
rises
higher
drowns
the
bed
it
is
then
that
ivan
nikolaevich
sleeps
with
a
blissful
face
the
next
morning
he
wakes
up
silent
but
perfectly
calm
and
well
his
needled
memory
grows
quiet
and
until
the
next
full
moon
no
one
will
trouble
